9</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>More than half a century ago Lady Charlotte Guest gave <i>The 
Mabinogion</i> to English readers in the form which, probably, 
will ever most delight them.&nbsp; Her transcript of the Red Book
of Hergest was not perfect, she found the meaning of many a Welsh
phrase obscure, but her rendering is generally very accurate; and
the Celtic tales retain in their new dress much of the charm, 
which so often evades the translator, of a perfect style formed 
by generations of narrating.</p>
<p>The Red Book of Hergest, from which <i>The Mabinogion</i> are 
taken, is a collection of tales and poems written during the 
fourteenth century.&nbsp; Some of the Mabinogion in it have been 
reconstructed in Norman and Crusading times, but they contain 
reminiscences of a more distant period, often but half understood
by the later story-teller.&nbsp; Among these are &ldquo;The Dream
of Rhonabwy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lady of the Fountain,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Peredur the son of Evrawc&rdquo;&mdash;the three which 
happen to come first in the Red Book.&nbsp; These are Christian, 
but with distant glimpses of <!-- page 10--><a 
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Celtic 
heathenism.&nbsp; The adventures are all grouped around Arthur 
and his knights; and a kind of connection is given to the three 
tales by the presence of Owen and his mysterious ravens.</p>
<p>Others, especially the four Mabinogion properly so called and 
the Tale of Lludd and Llevelys, are far older; they are older 
than Christianity, and older than Arthur.</p>
<p>In this new edition of Lady Guest&rsquo;s translation I have 
put, in the form of footnotes, what appears to me to be a more 
correct or a more literal rendering of some of the passages of 
the Welsh.&nbsp; This course makes it unnecessary to tamper with 
the charming translation that has become a classic of the English
language.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the Principal and Fellows of Jesus 
College for access to the Red Book, to Dr J. Gwenogvryn Evans for
permission to use his edition and to Lord Wimborne (the Ivor of 
Lady Guest&rsquo;s dedication) for information kindly given.</p>

<h2><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
15</span>THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN.</h2>
<p>King Arthur <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15" 
class="citation">[15]</a> was at Caerlleon upon Usk; and one day 
he sat in his chamber; and with him were Owain the son of Urien, 
and Kynon the son of Clydno, and Kai the son of Kyner; and 
Gwenhwyvar and her hand-maidens at needlework by the 
window.&nbsp; And if it should be said that there was a porter at
Arthur&rsquo;s palace, there was none.&nbsp; Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr 
was there, acting as porter, to welcome guests and strangers, and
to receive them with honour, and to inform them of <!-- page 
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the 
manners and customs of the Court; and to direct those who came to
the Hall or to the presence chamber, and those who came to take 
up their lodging. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16" 
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p>In the centre of the chamber king Arthur sat, upon a seat of 
green rushes, over which was spread a covering of flame-coloured 
satin; and a cushion of red satin was under his elbow.</p>
<p>Then Arthur spoke, &ldquo;If I thought you would not disparage
me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I would sleep while I wait for my 
repast; and you can entertain one another with relating tales, 
and can obtain a flagon of mead and some meat from 
Kai.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the King went to sleep.&nbsp; And Kynon the
son of Clydno asked Kai for that which Arthur had promised 
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I too will have the good tale which he 
promised to me,&rdquo; said Kai.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; 
answered Kynon, &ldquo;fairer will it be for thee to fulfil 
Arthur&rsquo;s behest in the first place, and then we will tell 
thee the best tale that we know.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Kai went to the 
kitchen and to the mead-cellar, and returned, bearing a flagon of
mead, and a golden goblet, and a handful of skewers upon which 
were broiled collops of meat.&nbsp; Then they ate the collops and
began to drink the mead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now&rdquo; said Kai, 
&ldquo;it is time for you to give me my story.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Kynon,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;do thou pay to Kai the 
tale that is his due.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said 
Kynon, &ldquo;thou art older, and are a better teller of tales, 
and hast seen more marvellous things than I; do thou therefore 
pay Kai his tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Begin <!-- page 17--><a 
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
17</span>thyself,&rdquo; quoth Owain, &ldquo;with the best that 
thou knowest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; answered 
Kynon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the only son of my mother and father; and I was 
exceedingly aspiring, and my daring was very great.&nbsp; I 
thought there was no enterprise in the world too mighty for me, 
and after I had achieved all the adventures that were in my own 
country, <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a" 
class="citation">[17a]</a> I equipped myself, and set forth to 
journey through deserts, and distant regions.&nbsp; And at length
it chanced that I came to the fairest valley in the world, 
wherein were trees of equal growth; and a river ran through the 
valley, and a path was by the side of the river.&nbsp; And I 
followed the path until mid-day, and continued my journey along 
the remainder of the valley until the evening; and at the 
extremity of a plain I came to a large and lustrous Castle, at 
the foot of which was a torrent.&nbsp; And I approached the 
Castle, and there I beheld two youths, with yellow curling hair, 
each with a frontlet of gold upon his head, and clad in a garment
of yellow satin; and they had gold clasps upon their 
insteps.&nbsp; In the hand of each of them was an ivory bow, 
strung with the sinews of the stag; and their arrows had their 
shafts of the bone of the whale, and were winged with 
peacock&rsquo;s feathers.&nbsp; The shafts also had golden 
heads.&nbsp; And they had daggers with blades of gold, and with 
hilts of the bone of the whale.&nbsp; And they were shooting 
their daggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little way from them, I saw a man <a 
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b" 
class="citation">[17b]</a> in the prime of life, with his beard 
newly shorn, clad in a robe and a mantle of yellow satin; and 
round the <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>top of his mantle was a band of gold 
lace.&nbsp; On his feet were shoes of variegated leather, 
fastened by two bosses of gold.&nbsp; When I saw him, I went 
towards him and saluted him; and such was his courtesy, that he 
no sooner received my greeting than he returned it. <a 
name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a" 
class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; And he went with me towards the 
Castle.&nbsp; Now there were no dwellers in the Castle, except 
those who were in one hall.&nbsp; And there I saw four and twenty
damsels, embroidering satin, at a window.&nbsp; And this I tell 
thee, Kai, that <a name="citation18b"></a><a href="#footnote18b" 
class="citation">[18b]</a> the least fair of them was fairer than
the fairest maid thou didst ever behold, in the Island of 
Britain; and the least lovely of them was more lovely than 
Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur, when she appeared loveliest at 
the Offering, on the day of the Nativity, or at the feast of 
Easter. <a name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c" 
class="citation">[18c]</a>&nbsp; They rose up at my coming, and 
six of them took my horse, and divested me of my armour; and six 
others took my arms, and washed them in a vessel, until they were
perfectly bright.&nbsp; And the third six spread cloths upon the 
tables, and prepared meat.&nbsp; And the fourth six took off my 
soiled garments, and placed others upon me; namely, an under vest
and a doublet of fine linen, and a robe, and a surcoat, and a 
mantle of yellow satin, and a broad gold band upon the 
mantle.&nbsp; And they placed cushions both beneath and around 
me, with coverings of red linen.&nbsp; And I sat down.&nbsp; Now 
the six maidens who had taken my horse, unharnessed him, as well 
as if they had been the best Squires in the Island of 
Britain.&nbsp; Then, behold, they <!-- page 19--><a 
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>brought bowls
of silver wherein was water to wash; and towels of linen, some 
green and some white; and I washed.&nbsp; And in a little while 
the man sat down to the table. <a name="citation19a"></a><a 
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; And I sat 
next to him, and below me sat all the maidens, except those who 
waited on us.&nbsp; And the table was of silver; and the cloths 
upon the table were of linen.&nbsp; And no vessel was served upon
the table that was not either of gold, or of silver, or of 
buffalo horn.&nbsp; And our meat was brought to us.&nbsp; And 
verily, Kai, I saw there every sort of meat, and every sort of 
liquor, that I ever saw elsewhere; but the meat and the liquors 
were better served there, than I ever saw them in any other 
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until the repast was half over, neither the man nor any
one of the damsels spoke a single word to me; but when the man 
perceived that it would be more agreeable to me to converse than 
to eat any more, he began to enquire of me who I was.&nbsp; I 
said I was glad to find that there was some one who would 
discourse with me, and that it was not considered so great a 
crime at that Court, for people to hold converse together.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Chieftain,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;we would have 
talked to thee sooner, but we feared to disturb thee during thy 
repast.&nbsp; Now, however, we will discourse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then 
I told the man who I was, and what was the cause of my 
journey.&nbsp; And said that I was seeking whether any one was 
superior to me, or whether I could gain the mastery over 
all.&nbsp; The man looked upon me, and he smiled, and said, 
&lsquo;If I did not fear to distress thee too much, <a 
name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b" 
class="citation">[19b]</a> I would shew thee that which thou 
seekest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Upon this I became anxious and sorrowful; 
and when the man <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>perceived it, he said, &lsquo;If thou
wouldst rather that I should shew thee thy disadvantage, than 
thine advantage, I will do so.&nbsp; Sleep here to-night, and in 
the morning, arise early, and take the road upwards through the 
valley, until thou reachest the wood, through which thou camest 
hither.&nbsp; A little way within the wood, thou wilt meet with a
road, branching off to the right; by which thou must proceed, 
until thou comest to a large sheltered glade, with a mound in the
centre.&nbsp; And thou wilt see a black man of great stature, on 
the top of the mound; he is not smaller in size than two of the 
men of this world.&nbsp; He has but one foot, and one eye, in the
middle of his forehead.&nbsp; And he has a club of iron, and it 
is certain that there are no two men in the world, who would not 
find their burden in that club.&nbsp; And he is not a comely man,
but on the contrary he is exceedingly ill favoured; and he is the
woodward of that wood.&nbsp; And thou wilt see a thousand wild 
animals, grazing around him.&nbsp; Enquire of him the way out of 
the glade, and he will reply to thee briefly, <a 
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20" 
class="citation">[20]</a> and will point out the road, by which 
thou shalt find that which thou art in quest of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And long seemed the night to me.&nbsp; And the next 
morning I arose, and equipped myself, and mounted my horse, and 
proceeded straight through the valley, to the wood, and I 
followed the crossroad which the man had pointed out to me, till 
at length I arrived at the glade.&nbsp; And there was I three 
times more astonished at the number of wild animals that I 
beheld, than the man had said I should be.&nbsp; And the black 
man was there, sitting upon the top of the mound.&nbsp; Huge of 
stature as the <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>man had told me that he was, I found 
him to exceed by far the description he had given me of 
him.&nbsp; As for the iron club, which the man had told me was a 
burden for two men, I am certain, Kai, that it would be a heavy 
weight for four warriors to lift.&nbsp; And this was in the black
man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; And he only spoke to me in answer to my 
questions. <a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a" 
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Then I asked him what power he 
held over those animals.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will shew thee, little 
man,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; And he took his club in his hand, and 
with it he struck a stag a great blow, so that he brayed 
vehemently, and at his braying, the animals came together, as 
numerous as the stars in the sky, so that it was difficult for me
to find room in the glade, to stand among them.&nbsp; There were 
serpents, and dragons, and divers sorts of animals.&nbsp; And he 
looked at them, and bade them go and feed.&nbsp; And they bowed 
their heads, and did him homage, as vassals to their lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the black man said to me, &lsquo;Seest thou now, 
little man, what power I hold over these animals?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Then I enquired of him the way; and he became very rough in his 
manner to me; however he asked me whither I would go.&nbsp; And 
when I had told him who I was, and what I sought, he directed 
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that path that 
leads towards the head of the glade, and ascend the wooded steep,
until thou comest to its summit; and there thou wilt find an open
space, like to a large valley, and in the midst of it a tall 
tree, whose branches are greener than the greenest pine 
trees.&nbsp; Under this tree is a fountain, and by the side of 
the fountain, a marble slab, and on the marble slab a silver 
bowl, attached by a chain of silver, so that it may not be 
carried away. <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b" 
class="citation">[21b]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a 
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Take the 
bowl, and throw a bowlful of water upon the slab, and thou wilt 
hear a mighty peal of thunder; so that thou wilt think that 
heaven and earth are trembling with its fury.&nbsp; With the 
thunder there will come a shower so severe, that it will be 
scarcely possible for thee to endure it and live.&nbsp; And the 
shower will be of hailstones.&nbsp; And after the shower, the 
weather will become fair; but every leaf that was upon the tree 
will have been carried away by the shower.&nbsp; Then a flight of
birds will come and alight upon the tree; and in thine own 
country thou didst never hear a strain so sweet, as that which 
they will sing.&nbsp; And at the moment thou art most delighted 
with the song of the birds, thou wilt hear a murmuring and 
complaining coming towards thee along the valley.&nbsp; And thou 
wilt see a knight upon a coal black horse, clothed in black 
velvet, and with a pennon of black linen upon his lance, and he 
will ride unto thee to encounter thee, with the utmost 
speed.&nbsp; If thou fleest from him he will overtake thee, and 
if thou abidest there, as sure as thou art a mounted knight, he 
will leave thee on foot.&nbsp; And if thou dost not find trouble 
in that adventure, thou needst not seek it during the rest of thy
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I journeyed on, until I reached the summit of the 
steep.&nbsp; And there I found every thing, as the black man had 
described it to me.&nbsp; And I went up to the tree, and beneath 
it I saw the fountain, and by its side the marble slab; and the 
silver bowl, fastened by the chain.&nbsp; Then I took the bowl, 
and cast a bowlful of water upon the slab; and thereupon behold 
the thunder came, much more violent than the black man had led me
to expect; and after the thunder came the shower; and of a truth 
I tell thee, Kai, that there is neither man nor beast that could 
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
23</span>endure that shower and live.&nbsp; For not one of those 
hailstones would be stopped either by the flesh, or by the skin, 
until it had reached the bone.&nbsp; I turned my horse&rsquo;s 
flanks towards the shower, and placed the beak of my shield over 
his head and neck, while I held the upper part of it over my own 
head.&nbsp; And thus I withstood the shower.&nbsp; When I looked 
on the tree, there was not a single leaf upon it, and then the 
sky became clear; and with that, behold the birds lighted upon 
the tree, and sang.&nbsp; And truly, Kai, I never heard any 
melody equal to that, either before or since.&nbsp; And when I 
was most charmed with listening to the birds, lo, a murmuring 
voice was heard through the valley, approaching me, and saying, 
&lsquo;Oh, Knight, what has brought thee hither?&nbsp; What evil 
have I done to thee, that thou shouldest act towards me and my 
possessions, as thou hast this day?&nbsp; Dost thou not know that
the shower to-day has left in my dominions neither man nor beast 
alive, that was exposed to it?&rsquo;&nbsp; And thereupon, behold
a Knight on a black horse appeared, clothed in jet black velvet, 
and with a tabard of black linen about him.&nbsp; And we charged 
each other; and as the onset was furious, it was not long before 
I was overthrown.&nbsp; Then the Knight passed the shaft of his 
lance through the bridle rein of my horse, and rode off with the 
two horses; leaving me where I was.&nbsp; And he did not even 
bestow so much notice upon me, as to imprison me, nor did he 
despoil me of my arms.&nbsp; So I returned along the road by 
which I had come.&nbsp; And when I reached the glade where the 
black man was, I confess to thee, Kai, it is a marvel that I did 
not melt down into a liquid pool, through the shame that I felt 
at the black man&rsquo;s derision.&nbsp; And that night I came to
the same Castle, where I had spent the night preceding.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
24</span>And I was more agreeably entertained that night, than I 
had been the night before; and I was better feasted, and I 
conversed freely with the inmates of the Castle; and none of them
alluded to my expedition to the fountain, neither did I mention 
it to any.&nbsp; And I remained there that night.&nbsp; When I 
arose on the morrow, I found ready saddled a dark-bay palfrey, 
with nostrils as red as scarlet.&nbsp; And after putting on my 
armour, and leaving there my blessing, I returned to my own 
Court.&nbsp; And that horse I still possess, and he is in the 
stable yonder.&nbsp; And I declare that I would not part with him
for the best palfrey in the Island of Britain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now of a truth, Kai, no man ever before confessed to an
adventure so much to his own discredit; and verily it seems 
strange to me, that neither before nor since have I heard of any 
person, besides myself, who knew of this adventure, and that the 
subject of it should exist within King Arthur&rsquo;s dominions, 
without any other person lighting upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; quoth Owain, &ldquo;would it not be well to
go and endeavour to discover that place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the hand of my friend,&rdquo; said Kai, &ldquo;often
dost thou utter that with thy tongue, which thou wouldest not 
make good with thy deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In very truth,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;it were 
better thou wert hanged, Kai, than to use such uncourteous speech
towards a man like Owain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the hand of my friend, good Lady,&rdquo; said Kai, 
&ldquo;thy praise of Owain is not greater than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Arthur awoke, and asked if he had not been sleeping 
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lord,&rdquo; answered Owain, &ldquo;thou hast 
slept awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
25</span>&ldquo;Is it time for us to go to meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Lord,&rdquo; said Owain.</p>
<p>Then the horn for washing was sounded, and the King and all 
his household sat down to eat.&nbsp; And when the meal was ended,
Owain withdrew to his lodging, and made ready his horse and his 
arms.</p>
<p>On the morrow, with the dawn of day, he put on his armour, and
mounted his charger, and travelled through distant lands, and 
over desert mountains.&nbsp; And at length he arrived at the 
valley which Kynon had described to him; and he was certain that 
it was the same that he sought.&nbsp; And journeying along the 
valley, by the side of the river, he followed its course till he 
came to the plain, and within sight of the Castle.&nbsp; When he 
approached the Castle, he saw the youths shooting their daggers, 
in the place where Kynon had seen them; and the yellow man, to 
whom the Castle belonged, standing hard by.&nbsp; And no sooner 
had Owain saluted the yellow man, than he was saluted by him in 
return.</p>
<p>And he went forward towards the Castle, and there he saw the 
chamber; and when he had entered the chamber, he beheld the 
maidens working at satin embroidery, in chairs of gold.&nbsp; And
their beauty, and their comeliness seemed to Owain far greater 
than Kynon had represented to him.&nbsp; And they arose to wait 
upon Owain, as they had done to Kynon.&nbsp; And the meal which 
they set before him, gave more satisfaction to Owain than it had 
done to Kynon.</p>
<p>About the middle of the repast the yellow man asked Owain the 
object of his journey.&nbsp; And Owain made it known to him, and 
said, &ldquo;I am in quest of the Knight who guards the 
fountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon this, the yellow man smiled, and said
that he was as loth to point out that adventure to Owain as he 
had been <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to Kynon.&nbsp; However he described 
the whole to Owain, and they retired to rest.</p>
<p>The next morning Owain found his horse made ready for him by 
the damsels, and he set forward and came to the glade where the 
black man was.&nbsp; And the stature of the black man seemed more
wonderful to Owain, than it had done to Kynon, and Owain asked of
him his road, and he showed it to him.&nbsp; And Owain followed 
the road, as Kynon had done, till he came to the green tree; and 
he beheld the fountain, and the slab beside the fountain with the
bowl upon it.&nbsp; And Owain took the bowl, and threw a bowlful 
of water upon the slab.&nbsp; And lo, the thunder was heard, and 
after the thunder came the shower, much more violent than Kynon 
had described, and after the shower, the sky became bright.&nbsp;
And when Owain looked at the tree, there was not one leaf upon 
it.&nbsp; And immediately the birds came, and settled upon the 
tree, and sang.&nbsp; And when their song was most pleasing to 
Owain, he beheld a Knight coming towards him through the valley, 
and he prepared to receive him; and encountered him 
violently.&nbsp; Having broken both their lances, they drew their
swords, and fought blade to blade.&nbsp; Then Owain struck the 
Knight a blow through his helmet, head piece and visor, and 
through the skin, and the flesh, and the bone, until it wounded 
the very brain.&nbsp; Then the black Knight felt that he had 
received a mortal wound, upon which he turned his horse&rsquo;s 
head, and fled.&nbsp; And Owain pursued him, and followed close 
upon him, although he was not near enough to strike him with his 
sword.&nbsp; Thereupon Owain descried a vast and resplendent 
Castle.&nbsp; And they came to the Castle gate.&nbsp; And the 
black Knight was allowed to enter, and the portcullis was let 
fall <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>upon Owain; and it struck his horse behind the saddle, 
and cut him in two, and carried away the rowels of the spurs that
were upon Owain&rsquo;s heels.&nbsp; And the portcullis descended
to the floor.&nbsp; And the rowels of the spurs and part of the 
horse were without, and Owain, with the other part of the horse 
remained between the two gates, and the inner gate was closed, so
that Owain could not go thence; and Owain was in a perplexing 
situation.&nbsp; And while he was in this state, he could see 
through an aperture in the gate, a street facing him, with a row 
of houses on each side.&nbsp; And he beheld a maiden, with yellow
curling hair, and a frontlet of gold upon her head; and she was 
clad in a dress of yellow satin, and on her feet were shoes of 
variegated leather.&nbsp; And she approached the gate, and 
desired that it should be opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven knows, 
Lady,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;it is no more possible for me to 
open to thee from hence, than it is for thee to set me 
free.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the damsel, 
&ldquo;it is very sad that thou canst not be released, and every 
woman ought to succour thee, for I never saw one more faithful in
the service of ladies than thou.&nbsp; As a friend thou art the 
most sincere, and as a lover the most devoted.&nbsp; 
Therefore,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;whatever is in my power to do
for thy release, I will do it.&nbsp; Take this ring and put it on
thy finger, with the stone inside thy hand; and close thy hand 
upon the stone.&nbsp; And as long as thou concealest it, it will 
conceal thee.&nbsp; When they have consulted together, they will 
come forth to fetch thee, in order to put thee to death; <a 
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" 
class="citation">[27]</a> and they will be much grieved that they
cannot find thee.&nbsp; And I will await thee on the horseblock 
yonder; and thou wilt be able to see me, though I cannot see 
thee; <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>therefore come and place thy hand 
upon my shoulder, that I may know that thou art near me.&nbsp; 
And by the way that I go hence, do thou accompany me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went away from Owain, and he did all that the maiden 
had told him.&nbsp; And the people of the Castle came to seek 
Owain, to put him to death, and when they found nothing but the 
half of his horse, they were sorely grieved.</p>
<p>And Owain vanished from among them, and went to the maiden, 
and placed his hand upon her shoulder, whereupon she set off, and
Owain followed her, until they came to the door of a large and 
beautiful chamber, and the maiden opened it, and they went in, 
and closed the door.&nbsp; And Owain looked around the chamber, 
and behold there was not even a single nail in it, that was not 
painted with gorgeous colours; and there was not a single panel, 
that had not sundry images <a name="citation28"></a><a 
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> in gold portrayed 
upon it.</p>
<p>The maiden kindled a fire, and took water in a silver bowl, 
and put a towel of white linen on her shoulder, and gave Owain 
water to wash.&nbsp; Then she placed before him a silver table, 
inlaid with gold; upon which was a cloth of yellow linen; and she
brought him food.&nbsp; And of a truth, Owain never saw any kind 
of meat that was not there in abundance, but it was better cooked
there, than he ever found it in any other place.&nbsp; Nor did he
ever see so excellent a display of meat and drink as there.&nbsp;
And there was not one vessel from which he was served, that was 
not of gold, or of silver.&nbsp; And Owain ate and drank, until 
late in the afternoon, when lo, they heard a mighty clamour in 
the Castle; and Owain asked the maiden what that outcry 
was.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are administering extreme unction,&rdquo; 
said she, &ldquo;to the <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Nobleman who owns the 
Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Owain went to sleep.</p>
<p>The couch which the maiden had prepared for him was meet for 
Arthur himself; it was of scarlet, and fur, and satin, and 
sendall, and fine linen.&nbsp; In the middle of the night they 
heard a woeful outcry.&nbsp; &ldquo;What outcry again is 
this?&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Nobleman who owned the 
Castle is now dead,&rdquo; said the maiden.&nbsp; And a little 
after daybreak, they heard an exceeding loud clamour and 
wailing.&nbsp; And Owain asked the maiden what was the cause of 
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are bearing to the church, the body of the 
Nobleman who owned the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Owain rose up, and clothed himself, and opened a window of
the chamber, and looked towards the Castle; and he could see 
neither the bounds, nor the extent of the hosts that filled the 
streets.&nbsp; And they were fully armed; and a vast number of 
women were with them, both on horseback, and on foot; and all the
ecclesiastics in the city, singing.&nbsp; And it seemed to Owain 
that the sky resounded with the vehemence of their cries, and 
with the noise of the trumpets, and with the singing of the 
ecclesiastics. <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a" 
class="citation">[29a]</a>&nbsp; In the midst of the throng, he 
beheld the bier, over which was a veil of white linen; and wax 
tapers were burning beside, and around it, and none that 
supported the bier was lower in rank than a powerful <a 
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b" 
class="citation">[29b]</a> Baron.</p>
<p>Never did Owain see an assemblage so gorgeous with satin, and 
silk, and sendall.&nbsp; And following the train, he beheld a 
lady with yellow hair falling over her shoulders, and stained 
with blood; and about her a dress of yellow satin, which was 
torn.&nbsp; Upon her feet were shoes of variegated leather.&nbsp;
And it was a <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>marvel that the ends of her fingers 
were not bruised, from the violence with which she smote her 
hands together.&nbsp; Truly she would have been the fairest lady 
Owain ever saw, had she been in her usual guise.&nbsp; And her 
cry was louder than the shout of the men, or the clamour of the 
trumpets. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30" 
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; No sooner had he beheld the lady,
than he became inflamed with her love, so that it took entire 
possession of him.</p>
<p>Then he enquired of the maiden who the lady was.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;she may be
said to be the fairest, and the most chaste, and the most 
liberal, and the wisest, and the most noble of women.&nbsp; And 
she is my mistress; and she is called the Countess of the 
Fountain, the wife of him whom thou didst slay 
yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Owain, 
&ldquo;she is the woman that I love best.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;she shall also love
thee not a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the maid arose, and kindled a fire, and filled a
pot with water, and placed it to warm; and she brought a towel of
white linen, and placed it around Owain&rsquo;s neck; and she 
took a goblet of ivory, and a silver basin, and filled them with 
warm water, wherewith she washed Owain&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Then 
she opened a wooden casket, and drew forth a razor, whose haft 
was of ivory, and upon which were two rivets of gold.&nbsp; And 
she shaved his beard, and she dried his head, and his throat, 
with the towel.&nbsp; Then she rose up from before Owain, and 
brought him to eat.&nbsp; And truly Owain had never so good a 
meal, nor was he ever so well served.</p>
<p>When he had finished his repast, the maiden arranged his 
couch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and <!-- 
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>sleep, and I will go and woo for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
Owain went to sleep, and the maiden shut the door of the chamber 
after her, and went towards the Castle.&nbsp; When she came 
there, she found nothing but mourning, and sorrow; and the 
Countess in her chamber could not bear the sight of any one 
through grief.&nbsp; Luned came and saluted her, but the Countess
answered her not.&nbsp; And the maiden bent down towards her, and
said, &ldquo;What aileth thee, that thou answerest no one 
to-day?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Luned,&rdquo; said the Countess, 
&ldquo;what change hath befallen thee, that thou hast not come to
visit me in my grief?&nbsp; It was wrong in thee, and I having 
made thee rich; it was wrong in thee that thou didst not come to 
see me in my distress.&nbsp; That was wrong in thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Luned, &ldquo;I thought thy good sense 
was greater than I find it to be.&nbsp; Is it well for thee to 
mourn after that good man, or for anything else, that thou canst 
not have?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to heaven,&rdquo; said 
the Countess, &ldquo;that in the whole world there is not a man 
equal to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said Luned, 
&ldquo;for an ugly man would be as good as, or better than 
he.&rdquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31" 
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to 
heaven,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;that were it not 
repugnant to me to cause to be put to death one whom I have 
brought up, I would have thee executed, for making such a 
comparison to me.&nbsp; As it is, I will banish 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Luned, 
&ldquo;that thou hast no other cause to do so, than that I would 
have been of service to thee when <!-- page 32--><a 
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>thou didst 
not know what was to thine advantage.&nbsp; And henceforth evil 
betide whichever of us shall make the first advance towards 
reconciliation to the other; whether I should seek an invitation 
from thee, or thou of thine own accord shouldest seek to invite 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that Luned went forth; and the Countess arose and 
followed her to the door of the chamber, and began coughing 
loudly.&nbsp; And when Luned looked back, the Countess beckoned 
to her; and she returned to the Countess.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 
truth,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;evil is thy disposition; 
but if thou knowest what is to my advantage, declare it to 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so,&rdquo; quoth she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest that except by warfare and arms it is 
impossible for thee to preserve thy possessions; delay not, 
therefore, to seek some one who can defend them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And how can I do that?&rdquo; said the Countess.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I will tell thee,&rdquo; said Luned, &ldquo;unless thou 
canst defend the fountain, thou canst not maintain thy dominions;
and no one can defend the fountain, except it be a knight of 
Arthur&rsquo;s household; and I will go to Arthur&rsquo;s court, 
and ill betide me, if I return thence without a warrior who can 
guard the fountain, as well as, or even better than, he who 
defended it formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will be hard to 
perform,&rdquo; said the Countess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, however, and 
make proof of that which thou hast promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luned set out, under the pretence of going to Arthur&rsquo;s 
court; but she went back to the chamber where she had left Owain;
and she tarried there with him as long as it might have taken her
to have travelled to the Court of King Arthur.&nbsp; And at the 
end of that time, she apparelled herself, and went to visit the 
Countess.&nbsp; And the Countess was much rejoiced when she saw 
her, and enquired what news <!-- page 33--><a 
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>she brought 
from the Court.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bring thee the best of 
news,&rdquo; said Luned, &ldquo;for I have compassed the object 
of my mission.&nbsp; When wilt thou, that I should present to 
thee the chieftain who has come with me hither?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Bring him here to visit me to-morrow, at mid-day,&rdquo; 
said the Countess, &ldquo;and I will cause the town to be 
assembled by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Luned returned home.&nbsp; And the next day, at noon, 
Owain arrayed himself in a coat, and a surcoat, and a mantle of 
yellow satin, upon which was a broad band of gold lace; and on 
his feet were high shoes of variegated leather, which were 
fastened by golden clasps, in the form of lions.&nbsp; And they 
proceeded to the chamber of the Countess.</p>
<p>Right glad was the Countess of their coming.&nbsp; And she 
gazed steadfastly upon Owain, and said, &ldquo;Luned, this knight
has not the look of a traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What harm is
there in that, Lady?&rdquo; said Luned.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am 
certain,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;that no other man than 
this, chased the soul from the body of my lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;So much the better for thee, Lady,&rdquo; said Luned, 
&ldquo;for had he not been stronger than thy lord, he could not 
have deprived him of life.&nbsp; There is no remedy for that 
which is past, be it as it may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go back to 
thine abode,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;and I will take 
counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, the Countess caused all her subjects to 
assemble, and shewed them that her Earldom was left defenceless, 
and that it could not be protected but with horse and arms, and 
military skill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said she, 
&ldquo;this is what I offer for your choice: either let one of 
you take me, or give your consent for me to take a husband from 
elsewhere, to defend my dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they came to the determination, that it was <!-- page 
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>better that she should have permission to marry some one
from elsewhere; and thereupon she sent for the Bishops and 
Archbishops, to celebrate her nuptials with Owain.&nbsp; And the 
men of the Earldom did Owain homage.</p>
<p>And Owain defended the Fountain with lance and sword.&nbsp; 
And this is the manner in which he defended it.&nbsp; Whensoever 
a knight came there, he overthrew him, and sold him for his full 
worth.&nbsp; And what he thus gained, he divided among his 
Barons, and his Knights; and no man in the whole world could be 
more beloved than he was by his subjects.&nbsp; And it was thus 
for the space of three years.</p>
<p>It befell that as Gwalchmai went forth one day with King 
Arthur, he perceived him to be very sad and sorrowful.&nbsp; And 
Gwalchmai was much grieved to see Arthur in this state; and he 
questioned him, saying, &ldquo;Oh my Lord! what has befallen 
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In sooth, Gwalchmai,&rdquo; said 
Arthur, &ldquo;I am grieved concerning Owain, whom I have lost 
these three years; and I shall certainly die, if the fourth year 
passes without my seeing him.&nbsp; Now I am sure, that it is 
through the tale which Kynon the son of Clydno related, that I 
have lost Owain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no need for 
thee,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;to summon to arms thy whole 
dominions, on that account; for thou thyself, and the men of thy 
household, will be able to avenge Owain, if he be slain; or to 
set him free, if he be in prison; and if alive, to bring him back
with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was settled, according to what 
Gwalchmai had said.</p>
<p>Then Arthur and the men of his household prepared to go and 
seek Owain; and their number was three thousand, beside their 
attendants.&nbsp; And Kynon <!-- page 35--><a 
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the son of 
Clydno acted as their guide.&nbsp; And Arthur came to the Castle,
where Kynon had been before.&nbsp; And when he came there the 
youths were shooting in the same place, and the yellow man was 
standing hard by.&nbsp; When the yellow man saw Arthur, he 
greeted him, and invited him to the Castle.&nbsp; And Arthur 
accepted his invitation, and they entered the Castle 
together.&nbsp; And great as was the number of his retinue, their
presence was scarcely observed in the Castle, so vast was its 
extent.&nbsp; And the maidens rose up to wait on them.&nbsp; And 
the service of the maidens appeared to them all to excel any 
attendance they had ever met with; and even the pages who had 
charge of the horses, were no worse served, that night, than 
Arthur himself would have been, in his own Palace.</p>
<p>The next morning, Arthur set out thence, with Kynon for his 
guide, and came to the place where the black man was.&nbsp; And 
the stature of the black man was more surprising to Arthur, than 
it had been represented to him.&nbsp; And they came to the top of
the wooded steep, and traversed the valley, till they reached the
green tree; where they saw the fountain, and the bowl and the 
slab.&nbsp; And upon that, Kai came to Arthur, and spoke to 
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know the 
meaning of all this, and my request is, that thou wilt permit me 
to throw the water on the slab, and to receive the first 
advantage that may befall.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Arthur gave him 
leave.</p>
<p>Then Kai threw a bowlful of water upon the slab, and 
immediately there came the thunder, and after the thunder the 
shower.&nbsp; And such a thunderstorm they had never known 
before.&nbsp; And many of the attendants who were in 
Arthur&rsquo;s train were killed by the shower.&nbsp; After the 
shower had ceased, the sky <!-- page 36--><a 
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>became 
clear.&nbsp; And on looking at the tree, they beheld it 
completely leafless.&nbsp; Then the birds descended upon the 
tree.&nbsp; And the song of the birds was far sweeter than any 
strain they had ever heard before.&nbsp; Then they beheld a 
Knight, on a coal-black horse, clothed in black satin, coming 
rapidly towards them.&nbsp; And Kai met him and encountered him, 
and it was not long before Kai was overthrown.&nbsp; And the 
Knight withdrew. <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36" 
class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; And Arthur and his host encamped 
for the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p36.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p36.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And when they arose in the morning, they perceived the signal 
of combat upon the lance of the Knight; and Kai came to Arthur, 
and spoke to him.&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;though I was overthrown yesterday, if it seem good to 
thee, I would gladly meet the Knight again to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thou mayst do so,&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; And Kai went 
towards the Knight.&nbsp; And on the spot he overthrew Kai, <a 
name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a" 
class="citation">[37a]</a> and struck him with the head of his 
lance in the forehead, so that it broke his helmet and the 
headpiece, and pierced the skin, and the flesh, the breadth of 
the spearhead, even to the bone.&nbsp; And Kai returned to his 
companions.</p>
<p>After this, all the household of Arthur went forth, one after 
the other, to combat the Knight, until there was not one that was
not overthrown by him, except Arthur and Gwalchmai.&nbsp; And 
Arthur armed himself to encounter the Knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, my
lord,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;permit me to fight with him 
first.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Arthur permitted him.&nbsp; And he went 
forth to meet the Knight, having over himself and his horse, a 
satin robe of honour which had been sent him by the daughter of 
the Earl of Rhangyw, and in this dress he was not known by any of
the host.&nbsp; And they charged each other, and fought all that 
day until the evening.&nbsp; And neither of them was able to 
unhorse the other.</p>
<p>The next day they fought with strong lances; and neither of 
them could obtain the mastery.</p>
<p>And the third day they fought with exceeding strong 
lances.&nbsp; And they were increased with rage, and fought 
furiously, even until noon.&nbsp; And they gave each other such a
shock, that the girths of their horses were broken, so that they 
fell over their horses&rsquo; cruppers to the ground.&nbsp; And 
they rose up speedily, and drew their swords, and resumed the 
combat. <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b" 
class="citation">[37b]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 38--><a 
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>And the 
multitude that witnessed the encounter felt assured that they had
never before seen two men so valiant, or so powerful.&nbsp; And 
had it been midnight, it would have been light from the fire that
flashed from their weapons.&nbsp; And the Knight gave Gwalchmai a
blow that turned his helmet from off his face, so that the Knight
knew that it was Gwalchmai.&nbsp; Then Owain said, &ldquo;My lord
Gwalchmai, I did not know thee for my cousin, owing to the robe 
of honour, that enveloped thee; take my sword and my 
arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;Thou, Owain, art the 
victor; take thou my sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that Arthur saw
that they were conversing, and advanced towards them.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;My lord Arthur,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;here is 
Owain, who has vanquished me, and will not take my 
arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;it 
is he that has vanquished me, and he will not take my 
sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me your swords,&rdquo; said 
Arthur, &ldquo;and then neither of you has vanquished the 
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Owain put his arms around Arthur&rsquo;s
neck, and they embraced.&nbsp; And all the host hurried forward 
to see Owain, and to embrace him.&nbsp; And there was nigh being 
a loss of life, so great was the press.</p>
<p>And they retired that night, and the next day Arthur prepared 
to depart.&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;this 
is not well of thee.&nbsp; For I have been absent from thee these
three years, <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38" 
class="citation">[38]</a> and during all that time, up to this 
very day, I have been preparing a banquet for thee, knowing that 
thou wouldest come to seek me.&nbsp; Tarry with me therefore, 
until thou and thy attendants have recovered the fatigues of the 
journey, and have been anointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they all proceeded to the Castle of the Countess of the 
Fountain, and the banquet which had been <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>three years 
preparing was consumed in three months.&nbsp; Never had they a 
more delicious or agreeable banquet.&nbsp; And Arthur prepared to
depart.&nbsp; Then he sent an embassy to the Countess, to beseech
her to permit Owain to go with him, for the space of three 
months, that he might shew him to the nobles, and the fair dames 
of the Island of Britain.&nbsp; And the Countess gave her 
consent, although it was very painful to her.&nbsp; So Owain came
with Arthur to the Island of Britain.&nbsp; And when he was once 
more amongst his kindred and friends, he remained three years, 
instead of three months, with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And as Owain one day sat at meat, in the City of Caerlleon 
upon Usk, behold a damsel entered, upon a bay horse, with a 
curling mane, and covered with foam; and the bridle, and as much 
as was seen of the saddle, were of gold.&nbsp; And the damsel was
arrayed in a dress of yellow satin.&nbsp; And she went up to 
Owain, and took the ring from off his hand.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;shall be treated the 
deceiver, the traitor, the faithless, the disgraced, and the 
beardless.&rdquo; <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39" 
class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; And she turned her horse&rsquo;s 
head, and departed.</p>
<p>Then his adventure came to Owain&rsquo;s remembrance, and he 
was sorrowful.&nbsp; And having finished eating, he went to his 
own abode, and made preparations that night.&nbsp; And the next 
day he arose, but did not go to the Court, but wandered to the 
distant parts of the earth, and to uncultivated mountains.&nbsp; 
And he remained there until all his apparel was worn out, and his
body was wasted away, and his hair was grown long.&nbsp; And he 
went about with the wild beasts, and fed with them, until they 
became familiar with him.&nbsp; But at length he grew so weak, 
that he could no longer bear <!-- page 40--><a 
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>them 
company.&nbsp; Then he descended from the mountains to the 
valley, and came to a park, that was the fairest in the world, 
and belonged to a widowed Countess.</p>
<p>One day the Countess and her maidens went forth to walk by a 
lake, that was in the middle of the park.&nbsp; And they saw the 
form of a man.&nbsp; And they were terrified.&nbsp; Nevertheless 
they went near him, and touched him, and looked at him.&nbsp; And
they saw that there was life in him, though he was exhausted by 
the heat of the sun.&nbsp; And the Countess returned to the 
Castle, and took a flask full of precious ointment, and gave it 
to one of her maidens.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go with this,&rdquo; said 
she, &ldquo;and take with thee yonder horse, and clothing, and 
place them near the man we saw just now.&nbsp; And anoint him 
with this balsam, near his heart; and if there is life in him, he
will arise, through the efficacy of this balsam.&nbsp; Then watch
what he will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the maiden departed from her, and poured the whole of the 
balsam upon Owain, and left the horse and the garments hard by, 
and went a little way off, and hid herself, to watch him.&nbsp; 
In a short time she saw him begin to move his arms; and he arose 
up, and looked at his person, and became ashamed of the 
unseemliness of his appearance.&nbsp; Then he perceived the horse
and the garments, that were near him.&nbsp; And he crept forward 
till he was able to draw the garments to him from off the 
saddle.&nbsp; And he clothed himself, and with difficulty mounted
the horse.&nbsp; Then the damsel discovered herself to him, and 
saluted him.&nbsp; And he was rejoiced when he saw her, and 
enquired of her, what land and what territory that was.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;a widowed Countess 
owns yonder Castle; at the death of her husband, <!-- page 
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>he 
left her two Earldoms, but at this day she has but this one 
dwelling that has not been wrested from her, by a young Earl, who
is her neighbour, because she refused to become his 
wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is pity,&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; 
And he and the maiden proceeded to the Castle; and he alighted 
there, and the maiden conducted him to a pleasant chamber, and 
kindled a fire, and left him.</p>
<p>And the maiden came to the Countess, and gave the flask into 
her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! maiden,&rdquo; said the Countess, 
&ldquo;where is all the balsam?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have I not 
used it all?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, maiden,&rdquo; 
said the Countess, &ldquo;I cannot easily forgive thee this; it 
is sad for me to have wasted seven-score pounds&rsquo; worth of 
precious ointment, upon a stranger whom I know not.&nbsp; 
However, maiden, wait thou upon him, until he is quite 
recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the maiden did so, and furnished him with meat and drink, 
and fire, and lodging, and medicaments, until he was well 
again.&nbsp; And in three months he was restored to his former 
guise, and became even more comely, than he had ever been 
before.</p>
<p>One day Owain heard a great tumult, and a sound of arms in the
Castle, and he enquired of the maiden the cause thereof.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The Earl,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;whom I mentioned to 
thee, has come before the Castle, with a numerous army, to subdue
the Countess.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Owain enquired of her whether the 
Countess had a horse and arms, in her possession.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;She has the best in the world,&rdquo; said the 
maiden.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou go and request the loan of a horse
and arms for me,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;that I may go and look
at this army?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the 
maiden.</p>
<p>And she came to the Countess, and told her what Owain had 
said.&nbsp; And the Countess laughed.&nbsp; <!-- page 42--><a 
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
42</span>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will even give 
him a horse and arms, for ever; such a horse and such arms, had 
he never yet, and I am glad that they should be taken by him 
to-day, lest my enemies should have them against my will 
to-morrow.&nbsp; Yet I know not what he would do with 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess bade them bring out a beautiful black steed, upon
which was a beechen saddle, and a suit of armour, for man and 
horse.&nbsp; And Owain armed himself, and mounted the horse, and 
went forth, attended by two pages completely equipped, with 
horses and arms.&nbsp; And when they came near to the 
Earl&rsquo;s army, they could see neither its extent, nor its 
extremity.&nbsp; And Owain asked the pages in which troop the 
Earl was.&nbsp; &ldquo;In yonder troop,&rdquo; said they, 
&ldquo;in which are four yellow standards.&nbsp; Two of them are 
before, and two behind him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said 
Owain, &ldquo;do you return and await me near the portal of the 
Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they returned, and Owain pressed forward,
until he met the Earl.&nbsp; And Owain drew him completely out of
his saddle, and turned his horse&rsquo;s head towards the Castle,
and, though it was with difficulty, he brought the Earl to the 
portal, where the pages awaited him.&nbsp; And in they 
came.&nbsp; And Owain presented the Earl as a gift to the 
Countess.&nbsp; And said to her, &ldquo;Behold a requittal to 
thee for thy blessed balsam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The army encamped around the Castle.&nbsp; And the Earl 
restored to the Countess the two Earldoms, he had taken from her,
as a ransom for his life; and for his freedom, he gave her the 
half of his own dominions, and all his gold, and his silver, and 
his jewels, besides hostages.</p>
<p>And Owain took his departure.&nbsp; And the Countess and all 
her subjects besought him to remain, but <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Owain chose 
rather to wander through distant lands and deserts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p43.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p43.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And as he journeyed, he heard a loud yelling in a wood.&nbsp; 
And it was repeated a second and a third time.&nbsp; And Owain 
went towards the spot, and behold a huge craggy mound, in the 
middle of the wood; on the side of which was a grey rock.&nbsp; 
And there was a cleft in the rock, and a serpent was within the 
cleft.&nbsp; And near the rock, stood a black lion, and every 
time the lion sought to go thence, the serpent darted towards him
to attack him.&nbsp; And Owain unsheathed his sword, and drew 
near to the rock; and as the serpent sprung out, he struck him 
with his sword, and cut him in two.&nbsp; And he dried his sword,
and went on his way, as before.&nbsp; But behold the lion 
followed him, and played about him, as though it had been a 
greyhound, that he had reared.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
44</span>They proceeded thus throughout the day, until the 
evening.&nbsp; And when it was time for Owain to take his rest, 
he dismounted, and turned his horse loose in a flat and wooded 
meadow.&nbsp; And he struck fire, and when the fire was kindled, 
the lion brought him fuel enough to last for three nights.&nbsp; 
And the lion disappeared.&nbsp; And presently the lion returned, 
bearing a fine large roebuck.&nbsp; And he threw it down before 
Owain, who went towards the fire with it.</p>
<p>And Owain took the roebuck, and skinned it, and placed collops
of its flesh upon skewers, around the fire.&nbsp; The rest of the
buck he gave to the lion to devour.&nbsp; While he was doing 
this, he heard a deep sigh near him, and a second, and a 
third.&nbsp; And Owain called out to know whether the sigh he 
heard proceeded from a mortal; and he received answer, that it 
did.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;I am Luned, the 
hand-maiden of the Countess of the Fountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And what dost thou here?&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am imprisoned,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;on account of the knight 
who came from Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and married the 
Countess.&nbsp; And he staid a short time with her, but he 
afterwards departed for the Court of Arthur, and he has not 
returned since.&nbsp; And he was the friend I loved best in the 
world.&nbsp; And two of the pages of the Countess&rsquo;s 
chamber, traduced him, and called him a deceiver.&nbsp; And I 
told them that they two were not a match for him alone.&nbsp; So 
they imprisoned me in the stone vault, and said that I should be 
put to death, unless he came himself, to deliver me, by a certain
day; and that is no further off, than the day after 
to-morrow.&nbsp; And I have no one to send to seek him for 
me.&nbsp; And his name is Owain the son of Urien.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;And art thou certain, that if that knight knew all this, 
he <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>would come to thy rescue?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am most 
certain of it,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>When the collops were cooked, Owain divided them into two 
parts, between himself and the maiden; and after they had eaten, 
they talked together until the day dawned.&nbsp; And the next 
morning Owain enquired of the damsel, if there was any place 
where he could get food and entertainment for that night.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There is, lord,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;cross over yonder,
and go along the side of the river, and in a short time, thou 
wilt see a great Castle, in which are many towers.&nbsp; And the 
Earl who owns that Castle, is the most hospitable man in the 
world.&nbsp; There thou mayest spend the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never did sentinel keep stricter watch over his lord, than the
lion that night over Owain.</p>
<p>And Owain accoutred his horse, and passed across by the ford, 
and came in the sight of the Castle.&nbsp; And he entered it, and
was honourably received.&nbsp; And his horse was well cared for, 
and plenty of fodder was placed before him.&nbsp; Then the lion 
went and laid down in the horse&rsquo;s manger; so that none of 
the people of the Castle dared to approach him.&nbsp; The 
treatment which Owain met with there, was such as he had never 
known elsewhere, for every one was as sorrowful, as though death 
had been upon him. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; And they went to meat.&nbsp; And 
the Earl sat upon one side of Owain; and on the other side his 
only daughter.&nbsp; And Owain had never seen any more lovely 
than she.&nbsp; Then the lion came and placed himself between 
Owain&rsquo;s feet, and he fed him with every kind of food, that 
he took himself.&nbsp; And he never saw any thing equal to the 
sadness of the people.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
46</span>In the middle of the repast, the Earl began to bid Owain
welcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;behold it 
is time for thee to be cheerful.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven 
knows,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;that it is not thy coming 
that makes us sorrowful, but we have cause enough for sadness and
care.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I have two sons,&rdquo; replied the Earl, &ldquo;and 
yesterday they went to the mountains to hunt.&nbsp; Now there is 
on the mountain a monster, who kills men and devours them.&nbsp; 
And he seized my sons.&nbsp; And to-morrow is the time he has 
fixed to be here, and he threatens that he will then slay my sons
before my eyes, unless I will deliver into his hands this my 
daughter. <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a" 
class="citation">[46a]</a>&nbsp; He has the form of a man, but in
stature he is no less than a giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;that is 
lamentable.&nbsp; And which wilt thou do?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Heaven knows,&rdquo; said the Earl, &ldquo;it will be 
better that my sons should be slain, against my will, than I 
should voluntarily give up my daughter to him to ill-treat and 
destroy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they talked about other things, and 
Owain staid there that night.</p>
<p>The next morning, they heard an exceeding great clamour, which
was caused by the coming of the giant, with the two youths.&nbsp;
And the Earl was anxious both to protect his Castle, and to 
release his two sons. <a name="citation46b"></a><a 
href="#footnote46b" class="citation">[46b]</a>&nbsp; Then Owain 
put on his armour, and went forth to encounter the giant; and the
lion followed him.&nbsp; And when the giant saw that Owain was 
armed, he rushed towards him, and attacked him.&nbsp; And the 
lion fought with the giant, much more fiercely than Owain 
did.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
47</span>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;I should 
find no difficulty in fighting with thee, were it not for the 
animal that is with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon that Owain took the 
lion back to the Castle, and shut the gate upon him.&nbsp; And 
then he returned to fight the giant, as before.&nbsp; And the 
lion roared very loud, for he heard that it went hard with 
Owain.&nbsp; And he climbed up, till he reached the top of the 
Earl&rsquo;s Hall; and thence he got to the top of the Castle, 
and he sprang down from the walls, and went and joined 
Owain.&nbsp; And the lion gave the giant a stroke with his paw, 
which tore him from his shoulder to his hip, and his heart was 
laid bare.&nbsp; And the giant fell down dead.&nbsp; Then Owain 
restored the two youths to their father.</p>
<p>The Earl besought Owain to remain with him, and he would not, 
but set forward towards the meadow, where Luned was.&nbsp; And 
when he came there, he saw a great fire kindled, and two youths 
with beautiful curling auburn hair, were leading the maiden to 
cast her into the fire.&nbsp; And Owain asked them what charge 
they had against her.&nbsp; And they told him of the compact <a 
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47" 
class="citation">[47]</a> that was between them; as the maiden 
had done the night before.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said they, 
&ldquo;Owain has failed her, therefore we are taking her to be 
burnt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;he is
a good knight, and if he knew that the maiden was in such peril, 
I marvel that he came not to her rescue.&nbsp; But if you will 
accept me in his stead, I will do battle with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said the youths, &ldquo;by him who made 
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they attacked Owain, and he was hard beset by them.&nbsp; 
And with that the lion came to Owain&rsquo;s assistance; and they
two got the better of the young men.&nbsp; And they said to him, 
&ldquo;Chieftain, it was not <!-- page 48--><a 
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>agreed that 
we should fight, save with thyself alone, and it is harder for us
to contend with yonder animal, than with thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
Owain put the lion in the place where the maiden had been 
imprisoned, and blocked up the door with stones.&nbsp; And he 
went to fight with the young men as before.&nbsp; But Owain had 
not his usual strength, <a name="citation48"></a><a 
href="#footnote48" class="citation">[48]</a> and the two youths 
pressed hard upon him.&nbsp; And the lion roared incessantly at 
seeing Owain in trouble.&nbsp; And he burst through the wall, 
until he found a way out, and rushed upon the young men, and 
instantly slew them.&nbsp; So Luned was saved from being 
burned.</p>
<p>Then Owain returned with Luned, to the dominions of the 
Countess of the Fountain.&nbsp; And when he went thence, he took 
the Countess with him to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and she was his 
wife as long as she lived.</p>
<p>And they took the road that led to the Court of the savage 
black man.&nbsp; And Owain fought with him, and the lion did not 
quit Owain, until he had vanquished him.&nbsp; And when he 
reached the Court of the savage black man, he entered the hall: 
and beheld four and twenty ladies, the fairest that could be 
seen.&nbsp; And the garments which they had on, were not worth 
four and twenty pence.&nbsp; And they were as sorrowful as 
death.&nbsp; And Owain asked them the cause of their 
sadness.&nbsp; And they said, &ldquo;We are the daughters of 
Earls, and we all came here, with our husbands, whom we dearly 
loved.&nbsp; And we were received with honour and 
rejoicing.&nbsp; And we were thrown into a state of stupor, and 
while we were thus, the demon who owns this Castle, slew all our 
husbands, and took from us our horses, and our raiment, and our 
gold, and our silver.&nbsp; And the corpses of our husbands are 
still in this house, and many others with them.&nbsp; And this, 
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
49</span>Chieftain, is the cause of our grief, and we are sorry 
that thou art come hither, lest harm should befall 
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Owain was grieved, when he heard this.&nbsp; And he went 
forth from the Castle, and he beheld a Knight approaching him, 
who saluted him, in a friendly and cheerful manner, as if he had 
been a brother.&nbsp; And this was the savage black man.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;In very sooth,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;it is not to seek
thy friendship that I am here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In 
sooth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou shalt not find it 
then.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that they charged each other, and 
fought furiously.&nbsp; And Owain overcame him, and bound his 
hands behind his back.&nbsp; Then the black savage besought Owain
to spare his life, and spoke thus, &ldquo;My lord Owain,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;it was foretold, that thou shouldst come hither 
and vanquish me, and thou hast done so.&nbsp; I was a robber 
here, and my house was a house of spoil.&nbsp; But grant me my 
life, and I will become the keeper of an Hospice, and I will 
maintain this house as an Hospice for weak and for strong, as 
long as I live, for the good of thy soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Owain 
accepted the proposal of him, and remained there that night.</p>
<p>And the next day he took the four and twenty ladies, and their
horses, and their raiment, and what they possessed of goods, and 
jewels, and proceeded with them to Arthur&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; 
And if Arthur was rejoiced when he saw him, after he had lost him
the first time, his joy was now much greater.&nbsp; And of those 
ladies, such as wished to remain in Arthur&rsquo;s Court, 
remained there; and such as wished to depart, departed.</p>
<p>And thenceforward Owain dwelt at Arthur&rsquo;s Court, greatly
beloved as the head of his household, until he went away with his
followers; and those were the <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>army of three
hundred ravens which Kenverchyn had left him.&nbsp; And wherever 
Owain went with these, he was victorious.</p>
<p>And this is the tale of <span class="smcap">The Lady of the 
Fountain</span>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p51.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p51.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Earl Evrawc owned the Earldom of the North.&nbsp; And he had 
seven sons.&nbsp; And Evrawc maintained himself not so much by 
his own possessions as by attending tournaments, and wars, and 
combats.&nbsp; And, as it often befalls those who join in 
encounters and wars, he was slain, and six of his sons 
likewise.&nbsp; Now the name of his seventh son was Peredur, and 
he was the youngest of them.&nbsp; And he was not of an age to go
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
52</span>to wars and encounters, otherwise he might have been 
slain as his father and brothers.&nbsp; His mother was a scheming
and thoughtful woman, and she was very solicitous concerning this
her only son and his <a name="citation52"></a><a 
href="#footnote52" class="citation">[52]</a> possessions.&nbsp; 
So she took counsel with herself to leave the inhabited country, 
and to flee to the deserts and unfrequented wildernesses.&nbsp; 
And she permitted none to bear her company thither but women and 
boys, and spiritless men, who were both unaccustomed and unequal 
to war and fighting.&nbsp; And none dared to bring either horses 
or arms where her son was, lest he should set his mind upon 
them.&nbsp; And the youth went daily to divert himself in the 
forest, by flinging sticks and staves.&nbsp; And one day he saw 
his mother&rsquo;s flock of goats, and near the goats two hinds 
were standing.&nbsp; And he marvelled greatly that these two 
should be without horns, while the others had them.&nbsp; And he 
thought they had long run wild and on that account they had lost 
their horns.&nbsp; And by activity and swiftness of foot, he 
drove the hinds and the goats together into the house which there
was for the goats at the extremity of the forest.&nbsp; Then 
Peredur returned to his mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, mother,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;a marvellous thing have I seen in the wood; two 
of thy goats have run wild, and lost their horns; through their 
having been so long missing in the wood.&nbsp; And no man had 
ever more trouble than I had to drive them in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then 
they all arose and went to see.&nbsp; And when they beheld the 
hinds, they were greatly astonished.</p>
<p>And one day they saw three knights coming along the horse-road
on the borders of the forest.&nbsp; And the three knights were 
Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Geneir Gwystyl, and Owain the son
of Urien.&nbsp; <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>And Owain kept on the track of the 
knight who had divided the apples in Arthur&rsquo;s Court, whom 
they were in pursuit of.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;what are those yonder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They 
are angels, my son,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;By my 
faith,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I will go and become an angel 
with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peredur went to the road, and met 
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me, good soul,&rdquo; said Owain, 
&ldquo;sawest thou a knight pass this way, either to-day or 
yesterday?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; answered he, 
&ldquo;what a knight is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Such an one as I 
am,&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou wilt tell me what I 
ask thee, I will tell thee that which thou askest 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly will I do so,&rdquo; replied 
Owain.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; demanded Peredur, 
concerning the saddle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a saddle,&rdquo; said 
Owain.&nbsp; Then he asked about all the accoutrements which he 
saw upon the men, and the horses, and the arms, and what they 
were for, and how they were used.&nbsp; And Owain shewed him all 
these things fully, and told him what use was made of them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go forward,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;for I saw such an 
one as thou enquirest for, and I will follow thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Peredur returned to his mother and her company, and he 
said to her, &ldquo;Mother, those were not angels, but honourable
knights.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then his mother swooned away.&nbsp; And 
Peredur went to the place where they kept the horses that carried
firewood, and that brought meat and drink from the inhabited 
country to the desert.&nbsp; And he took a bony piebald horse, 
which seemed to him the strongest of them.&nbsp; And he pressed a
pack into the form of a saddle, and with twisted twigs he 
imitated the trappings which he had seen upon the horses.&nbsp; 
And when Peredur came again to his mother, the Countess had 
recovered from her swoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said she, 
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
54</span>&ldquo;desirest thou to ride forth?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Yes, with thy leave,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait 
then, that I may counsel thee before thou goest.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;speak 
quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go forward,&rdquo; then she said, 
&ldquo;to the Court of Arthur, where there are the best, and the 
boldest, and the most bountiful of men.&nbsp; And wherever thou 
seest a church, repeat there thy Paternoster unto it.&nbsp; And 
if thou see meat and drink, and hast need of them, and none have 
the kindness or the courtesy to give them to thee, take them 
thyself.&nbsp; If thou hear an outcry, proceed towards it, 
especially if it be the outcry of a woman.&nbsp; If thou see a 
fair jewel, possess thyself of it, and give it to another, for 
thus thou shalt obtain praise.&nbsp; If thou see a fair woman, 
pay thy court to her, whether she will or no; for thus thou wilt 
render thyself a better and more esteemed man than thou wast 
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this discourse, Peredur mounted the horse, and taking a 
handful of sharp pointed forks in his hand, he rode forth.&nbsp; 
And he journeyed two days and two nights in the woody 
wildernesses, and in desert places, without food and without 
drink.&nbsp; And then he came to a vast wild wood, and far within
the wood he saw a fair even glade, and in the glade he saw a 
tent, and seeming to him to be a church, he repeated his 
Paternoster to the tent.&nbsp; And he went towards it, and the 
door of the tent was open.&nbsp; And a golden chair was near the 
door.&nbsp; And on the chair sat a lovely auburn-haired maiden, 
with a golden frontlet on her forehead, and sparkling stones in 
the frontlet, and with a large gold ring on her hand.&nbsp; And 
Peredur dismounted, and entered the tent.&nbsp; And the maiden 
was glad at his coming, and bade him welcome.&nbsp; At the 
entrance of the <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>tent he saw food, and two flasks full
of wine, and two loaves of fine wheaten flour, and collops of the
flesh of the wild boar.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother told me,&rdquo; 
said Peredur, &ldquo;wheresoever I saw meat and drink, to take 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Take the meat and welcome, 
chieftain,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; So Peredur took half of the 
meat and of the liquor himself, and left the rest to the 
maiden.&nbsp; And when Peredur had finished eating, he bent upon 
his knee before the maiden.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;told me, wheresoever I saw a fair jewel, to take 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do so, my soul,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; So
Peredur took the ring.&nbsp; And he mounted his horse, and 
proceeded on his journey.</p>
<p>After this, behold the knight came, to whom the tent belonged;
and he was the Lord of the Glade.&nbsp; And he saw the track of 
the horse, and he said to the maiden, &ldquo;Tell me who has been
here since I departed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; said 
she, &ldquo;of wonderful demeanour.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she 
described to him what Peredur&rsquo;s appearance and conduct had 
been.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did he offer 
thee any wrong?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the 
maiden, &ldquo;by my faith, he harmed me not.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By my faith, I do not believe thee; and until I can meet 
with him, and revenge the insult he has done me, and wreak my 
vengeance upon him, thou shalt not remain two nights in the same 
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the knight arose, and set forth to seek 
Peredur.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Peredur journeyed on towards Arthur&rsquo;s 
Court.&nbsp; And before he reached it, another knight had been 
there, who gave a ring of thick gold at the door of the gate for 
holding his horse, and went into the Hall where Arthur and his 
household, and Gwenhwyvar and her maidens, were assembled.&nbsp; 
And the page of the chamber was serving Gwenhwyvar <!-- page 
56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>with 
a golden goblet.&nbsp; Then the knight dashed the liquor that was
therein upon her face, and upon her stomacher, and gave her a 
violent blow on the face, and said, &ldquo;If any have the 
boldness to dispute this goblet with me, and to avenge the insult
to Gwenhwyvar, let him follow me to the meadow, and there I will 
await him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the knight took his horse, and rode to
the meadow.&nbsp; And all the household hung down their heads, 
lest any of them should be requested to go and avenge the insult 
to Gwenhwyvar.&nbsp; For it seemed to them, that no one would 
have ventured on so daring an outrage, unless he possessed such 
powers, through magic or charms, that none could be able to take 
vengeance upon him.&nbsp; Then, behold Peredur entered the Hall, 
upon the bony piebald horse, with the uncouth trappings upon it; 
and in this way he traversed the whole length of the Hall. <a 
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56" 
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; In the centre of the Hall stood 
Kai.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me, tall man,&rdquo; said Peredur, 
&ldquo;is that Arthur, yonder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What wouldest 
thou with Arthur?&rdquo; asked Kai.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mother told 
me to go to Arthur, and receive the honour of 
knighthood.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and with 
arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he was perceived by all the 
household, and they threw sticks at him.&nbsp; Then, behold, a 
dwarf came forward.&nbsp; He had already been a year at 
Arthur&rsquo;s Court, both he and a female dwarf.&nbsp; They had 
craved harbourage of Arthur, and had obtained it; and during the 
whole year, neither of them had spoken a single word to any 
one.&nbsp; When the dwarf beheld Peredur, &ldquo;Ha ha!&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;the welcome of Heaven be unto thee, goodly 
Peredur, son of Evrawc, the chief of warriors, and flower of 
knighthood.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Kai, 
&ldquo;thou <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>art ill-taught to remain a year mute 
at Arthur&rsquo;s Court, with choice of society; and now, before 
the face of Arthur and all his household, to call out, and 
declare such a man as this the chief of warriors, and the flower 
of knighthood.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he gave him such a box on the 
ear, that he fell senseless to the ground.&nbsp; Then exclaimed 
the female dwarf, &ldquo;Ha ha! goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc; 
the welcome of Heaven be unto thee, flower of knights, and light 
of chivalry.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of a truth, maiden,&rdquo; said 
Kai, &ldquo;thou art ill-bred to remain mute for a year at the 
Court of Arthur and then to speak as thou dost of such a man as 
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Kai kicked her with his foot, so that she 
fell to the ground senseless.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tall man,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;show me which is Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold
thy peace,&rdquo; said Kai, &ldquo;and go after the knight who 
went hence to the meadow, and take from him the goblet, and 
overthrow him, and possess thyself of his horse and arms, and 
then thou shalt receive the order of knighthood.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I will do so, tall man,&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; So he 
turned his horse&rsquo;s head towards the meadow.&nbsp; And when 
he came there, the knight was riding up and down, proud of his 
strength, and valour, and noble mien.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell 
me,&rdquo; said the knight, &ldquo;didst thou see any one coming 
after me from the Court?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The tall man that 
was there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;desired me to come, and 
overthrow thee, and to take from thee the goblet, and thy horse 
and thy armour for myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; 
said the knight; &ldquo;go back to the Court, and tell Arthur, 
from me, either to come himself, or to send some other to fight 
with me; and unless he do so quickly, I will not wait for 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Peredur, 
&ldquo;choose thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly, 
but I will have the horse, and the arms, and the 
goblet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And upon this the <!-- page 58--><a 
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>knight ran at
him furiously, and struck him a violent blow <a 
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58" 
class="citation">[58]</a> with the shaft of his spear, between 
the neck and the shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha ha! lad,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;my mother&rsquo;s servants were not used to play 
with me in this wise; therefore, thus will I play with 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon he struck him with a sharp 
pointed fork, and it hit him in the eye, and came out at the back
of his neck, so that he instantly fell down lifeless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Picture" src="images/p58.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Owain the son of Urien to Kai, 
&ldquo;thou wert ill advised, when thou didst send that madman 
after the knight, for one of two things must befall him.&nbsp; He
must either be overthrown, or slain.&nbsp; If he is overthrown by
the knight, he will be counted by him to be an honourable person 
of the Court, and an eternal disgrace will it be to Arthur and 
his warriors.&nbsp; And if he is slain, the disgrace will be the 
same, and moreover, his sin will be upon him; therefore will I go
to see what has befallen him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Owain went to the 
meadow, and he found Peredur dragging the man about.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What art thou <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>doing thus?&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;This iron coat,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;will never 
come from off him; not by my efforts, at any rate.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a" 
class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; And Owain unfastened his armour 
and his clothes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, my good soul,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is a horse and armour better than thine.&nbsp; Take them 
joyfully, and come with me to Arthur, to receive the order of 
knighthood, for thou dost merit it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;May I 
never shew my face again, if I go,&rdquo; said Peredur, 
&ldquo;but take thou the goblet to Gwenhwyvar, and tell Arthur, 
that wherever I am, I will be his vassal, and will do him what 
profit and service I am able.&nbsp; And say that I will not come 
to his Court, until I have encountered the tall man that is 
there, to avenge the injury he did to the dwarf and 
dwarfess.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Owain went back to the Court, and 
related all these things to Arthur and Gwenhwyvar, and to all the
household. <a name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b" 
class="citation">[59b]</a></p>
<p>And Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And as he proceeded, behold a 
knight met him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence comest thou?&rdquo; said the 
knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come from Arthur&rsquo;s Court,&rdquo; 
said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art thou one of his men?&rdquo; asked 
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, by my faith,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;A good service, truly, is that of Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Wherefore sayest thou so?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I will tell thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have always 
been Arthur&rsquo;s enemy, and all such of his men as I have ever
encountered, I have slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; And without further 
parlance, they fought, and it was not long before Peredur brought
him to the ground, over his horse&rsquo;s crupper.&nbsp; Then the
knight besought his mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy thou shalt 
have,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;if thou wilt make oath to me, 
that thou wilt go to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and tell him that it 
was I that overthrew <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>thee, for the honour of his service; 
and say that I will never come to the Court, until I have avenged
the insult offered to the dwarf and dwarfess.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
knight pledged him his faith of this, and proceeded to the Court 
of Arthur, and said as he had promised, and conveyed the threat 
to Kai.</p>
<p>And Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And within that week he 
encountered sixteen knights, and overthrew them all 
shamefully.&nbsp; And they all went to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, 
taking with them the same message which the first knight had 
conveyed from Peredur, and the same threat which he had sent to 
Kai.&nbsp; And thereupon Kai was reproved by Arthur; and Kai was 
greatly grieved thereat.</p>
<p>And Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And he came to a vast and 
desert wood, on the confines of which was a lake.&nbsp; And on 
the other side was a fair castle.&nbsp; And on the border of the 
lake he saw a venerable hoary-headed man sitting upon a velvet 
cushion, and having a garment of velvet upon him.&nbsp; And his 
attendants were fishing in the lake.&nbsp; When the hoary-headed 
man beheld Peredur approaching, he arose, and went towards the 
castle.&nbsp; And the old man was lame.&nbsp; Peredur rode to the
palace, and the door was open, and he entered the hall.&nbsp; And
there was the hoary-headed man sitting on a cushion, and a large 
blazing fire burning before him.&nbsp; And the household and the 
company arose to meet Peredur, and disarrayed him.&nbsp; And the 
man asked the youth to sit on the cushion; and they sat down, and
conversed together.&nbsp; When it was time, the tables were laid,
and they went to meat.&nbsp; And when they had finished their 
meal, the man enquired of Peredur, if he knew well how to fight 
with the sword.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Peredur, 
&ldquo;but were I to be taught, doubtless I <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
61</span>should.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever can play well with 
the cudgel and shield, will also be able to fight with a 
sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the man had two sons; the one had yellow 
hair, and the other auburn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Arise, youth,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;and play with the cudgel and the 
shield.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so did they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me, my 
soul,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;which of the youths thinkest 
thou plays best?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;that the yellow-haired youth could draw blood 
from the other, if he chose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arise thou, my 
life, and take the cudgel and the shield from the hand of the 
youth with the auburn hair, and draw blood from the yellow-haired
youth, if thou canst.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Peredur arose, and went to 
play with the yellow-haired youth; and he lifted up his arm, and 
struck him such a mighty blow, that his brow fell over his eye, 
and the blood flowed forth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, my life,&rdquo; said
the man, &ldquo;come now, and sit down, for thou wilt become the 
best fighter with the sword of any in this island; and I am thy 
uncle, thy mother&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; And with me shalt thou 
remain a space, in order to learn the manners and customs of 
different countries, and courtesy, and gentleness, and noble 
bearing.&nbsp; Leave, then, the habits and the discourse of thy 
mother, and I will be thy teacher; and I will raise thee to the 
rank of knight from this time forward.&nbsp; And thus do 
thou.&nbsp; If thou seest aught to cause thee wonder, ask not the
meaning of it; if no one has the courtesy to inform thee, the 
reproach will not fall upon thee, but upon me that am thy 
teacher.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they had abundance of honour and 
service.&nbsp; And when it was time, they went to sleep.&nbsp; At
the break of day, Peredur arose, and took his horse, and with his
uncle&rsquo;s permission, he rode forth.&nbsp; And he came to a 
vast desert wood, and at the further end of the wood was a 
meadow, and on <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the other side of the meadow he saw a
large castle.&nbsp; And thitherward Peredur bent his way, and he 
found the gate open, and he proceeded to the hall.&nbsp; And he 
beheld a stately hoary-headed man sitting on one side of the 
hall, and many pages around him, who arose to receive and to 
honour Peredur.&nbsp; And they placed him by the side of the 
owner of the palace.&nbsp; Then they discoursed together; and 
when it was time to eat, they caused Peredur to sit beside the 
nobleman during the repast.&nbsp; And when they had eaten and 
drank as much as they desired, the nobleman asked Peredur, 
whether he could fight with a sword?&nbsp; &ldquo;Were I to 
receive instruction,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I think I 
could.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, there was on the floor of the hall a 
huge staple, as large as a warrior could grasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
yonder sword,&rdquo; said the man to Peredur, &ldquo;and strike 
the iron staple.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Peredur arose, and struck the 
staple, so that he cut it in two; and the sword broke into two 
parts also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Place the two parts together, and 
reunite them,&rdquo; and Peredur placed them together, and they 
became entire as they were before.&nbsp; And a second time he 
struck upon the staple, so that both it and the sword broke in 
two, and as before they reunited.&nbsp; And the third time he 
gave a like blow, and placed the broken parts together, and 
neither the staple nor the sword would unite, as before.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; said the nobleman, &ldquo;come now, and sit 
down, and my blessing be upon thee.&nbsp; Thou fightest best with
the sword of any man in the kingdom.&nbsp; Thou hast arrived at 
two-thirds of thy strength, and the other third thou hast not yet
obtained; and when thou attainest to thy full power, none will be
able to contend with thee.&nbsp; I am thy uncle, thy 
mother&rsquo;s brother, and I am brother <a 
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62" 
class="citation">[62]</a> to the man in whose house thou wast 
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>last night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Peredur and his uncle 
discoursed together, and he beheld two youths enter the hall, and
proceed up to the chamber, bearing a spear of mighty size, with 
three streams of blood flowing from the point to the 
ground.&nbsp; And when all the company saw this, they began 
wailing and lamenting.&nbsp; But for all that, the man did not 
break off his discourse with Peredur.&nbsp; And as he did not 
tell Peredur the meaning of what he saw, he forebore to ask him 
concerning <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>it.&nbsp; And when the clamour had a 
little subsided, behold two maidens entered, with a large salver 
between them, in which was a man&rsquo;s head, surrounded by a 
profusion of blood.&nbsp; And thereupon the company of the court 
made so great an outcry, that it was irksome to be in the same 
hall with them.&nbsp; But at length they were silent.&nbsp; And 
when time was that they should sleep, Peredur was brought into a 
fair chamber.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p63.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p63.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And the next day, with his uncle&rsquo;s permission, he rode 
forth.&nbsp; And he came to a wood, and far within the wood he 
heard a loud cry, and he saw a beautiful woman with auburn hair, 
and a horse with a saddle upon it, standing near her, and a 
corpse by her side.&nbsp; And as she strove to place the corpse 
upon the horse, it fell to the ground, and thereupon she made a 
great lamentation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me, sister,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;wherefore art thou bewailing?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh! accursed Peredur, little pity has my ill fortune ever 
met with from thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;am I accursed?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because thou 
wast the cause of thy mother&rsquo;s death; for when thou didst 
ride forth against her will, anguish seized upon her heart, so 
that she died; and therefore art thou accursed.&nbsp; And the 
dwarf and the dwarfess that thou sawest at Arthur&rsquo;s Court, 
were the dwarfs of thy father and mother; and I am thy 
foster-sister, and this was my wedded husband, and he was slain 
by the knight that is in the glade in the wood; and do not thou 
go near him, lest thou shouldest be slain by him 
likewise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My sister, thou dost reproach me 
wrongfully; through my having so long remained amongst you, I 
shall scarcely vanquish him; and had I continued longer it would,
indeed, be difficult for me to succeed.&nbsp; Cease, therefore, 
thy lamenting, for it is of no avail, <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and I will 
bury the body, and then I will go in quest of the knight, and see
if I can do vengeance upon him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when he had 
buried the body, they went to the place where the knight was, and
found him riding proudly along the glade; and he enquired of 
Peredur whence he came.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come from Arthur&rsquo;s 
Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And art thou one of Arthur&rsquo;s 
men?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, by my faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A 
profitable alliance, truly, is that of Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
without further parlance, they encountered one another, and 
immediately Peredur overthrew the knight, and he besought mercy 
of Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy shall thou have,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;upon these terms, that thou take this woman in marriage, 
and do her all the honour and reverence in thy power, seeing thou
hast, without cause, slain her wedded husband; and that thou go 
to Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and shew him that it was I that 
overthrew thee, to do him honour and service; and that thou tell 
him that I will never come to his Court again until I have met 
with the tall man that is there, to take vengeance upon him for 
his insult to the dwarf and the dwarfess.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he 
took the knight&rsquo;s assurance, that he would perform all 
this.&nbsp; Then the knight provided the lady with a horse and 
garments that were suitable for her, and took her with him to 
Arthur&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; And he told Arthur all that had 
occurred, and gave the defiance to Kai.&nbsp; And Arthur and all 
his household reproved Kai, for having driven such a youth as 
Peredur from his Court.</p>
<p>Said Owain the son of Urien, &ldquo;This youth will never come
into the Court until Kai has gone forth from it.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I will search all 
the deserts in the island of Britain, until I find Peredur, and 
then let him and his adversary do their utmost to each 
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
66</span>Then Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And he came to a desert
wood, where he saw not the track either of men or animals, and 
where there was nothing but bushes and weeds.&nbsp; And at the 
upper end of the wood he saw a vast castle, wherein were many 
strong towers; and when he came near the gate, he found the weeds
taller than he had done elsewhere.&nbsp; And he struck the gate 
with the shaft of his lance, and thereupon behold a lean 
auburn-haired youth came to an opening in the battlements.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Choose thou, chieftain,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Whether shall I open the gate unto thee, or shall I 
announce unto those that are chief, that thou art at the 
gateway?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say that I am here,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;and if it is desired that I should enter, I will 
go in.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the youth came back, and opened the gate 
for Peredur.&nbsp; And when he went into the hall, he beheld 
eighteen youths, lean and red-headed, of the same height and of 
the same aspect, and of the same dress, and of the same age as 
the one who had opened the gate for him.&nbsp; And they were well
skilled in courtesy and in service.&nbsp; And they disarrayed 
him.&nbsp; Then they sat down to discourse.&nbsp; Thereupon, 
behold five maidens came from the chamber into the hall.&nbsp; 
And Peredur was certain that he had never seen another of so fair
an aspect as the chief of the maidens.&nbsp; And she had an old 
garment of satin upon her, which had once been handsome, but was 
then so tattered, that her skin could be seen through it.&nbsp; 
And whiter was her skin than the bloom of crystal, and her hair 
and her two eyebrows were blacker than jet, and on her cheeks 
were two red spots, redder than whatever is reddest.&nbsp; And 
the maiden welcomed Peredur, and put her arms about his neck, and
made him sit down beside her.&nbsp; Not long after this he saw 
two nuns enter and a <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>flask full of wine was borne by one, 
and six loaves of white bread by the other.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;Heaven is witness, that 
there is not so much of food and liquor as this left in yonder 
Convent this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then they went to meat, and 
Peredur observed that the maiden wished to give more of the food 
and of the liquor to him than to any of the others.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I will share out 
the food and the liquor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so, my 
soul,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;By my faith, but I 
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Peredur took the bread, and he gave an 
equal portion of it to each alike, as well as a cup full of the 
liquor.&nbsp; And when it was time for them to sleep, a chamber 
was prepared for Peredur, and he went to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, sister,&rdquo; said the youths to the fairest 
and most exalted of the maidens, &ldquo;we have counsel for 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What may it be?&rdquo; she 
enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go to the youth that is in the upper 
chamber, and offer to become his wife, or the lady of his love, 
if it seem well to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That were indeed 
unfitting,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hitherto I have not been
the lady love of any knight, and to make him such an offer before
I am wooed by him, that, truly, can I not do.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By our confession to Heaven, unless thou actest thus, we 
will leave thee here to thy enemies, to do as they will with 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And through fear of this, the maiden went 
forth; and shedding tears, she proceeded to the chamber.&nbsp; 
And with the noise of the door opening, Peredur awoke; and the 
maiden was weeping and lamenting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me, my 
sister,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;wherefore dost thou 
weep?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell thee, lord,&rdquo; said 
she, &ldquo;my father possessed these dominions as their chief, 
and this palace was his, and with it he held the best earldom in 
the kingdom; then the son of another earl sought me of my father,
and I <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>was not willing to be given unto him,
and my father would not give me against my will, either to him or
any earl in the world.&nbsp; And my father had no child except 
myself.&nbsp; And after my father&rsquo;s death, these dominions 
came into my own hands, and then was I less willing to accept him
than before.&nbsp; So he made war upon me, and conquered all my 
possessions except this one house.&nbsp; And through the valour 
of the men whom thou hast seen, who are my foster brothers, and 
the strength of the house, it can never be taken while food and 
drink remain.&nbsp; And now our provisions are exhausted; but as 
thou hast seen, we have been fed by the nuns, to whom the country
is free.&nbsp; And at length they also are without supply of food
or liquor.&nbsp; And at no later date than to-morrow, the earl 
will come against this place with all his forces; and if I fall 
into his power, my fate will be no better than to be given over 
to the grooms of his horses.&nbsp; Therefore, lord, I am come to 
offer to place myself in thy hands, that thou mayest succour me, 
either by taking me hence, or by defending me here, whichever may
seem best unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, my sister,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;and sleep; nor will I depart from thee until I do
that which thou requirest, or prove whether I can assist thee or 
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; The maiden went again to rest; and the next 
morning she came to Peredur, and saluted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven
prosper thee, my soul, and what tidings dost thou 
bring?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;None other, than that the earl and all
his forces have alighted at the gate, and I never beheld any 
place so covered with tents, and thronged with knights 
challenging others to the combat.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;let my horse be made 
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; So his horse was accoutred, and he arose, and
sallied forth to the meadow.&nbsp; And there was <!-- page 
69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>a 
knight riding proudly along the meadow, having raised the signal 
for battle.&nbsp; And they encountered, and Peredur threw the 
knight over his horse&rsquo;s crupper to the ground.&nbsp; And at
the close of the day, one of the chief knights came to fight with
him, and he overthrew him also, so that he besought his 
mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am Master of the 
Household to the earl.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And how much of the 
Countess&rsquo;s possessions is there in thy power?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The third part, verily,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;restore to her the third
of her possessions in full, and all the profit thou hast made by 
them, and bring meat and drink for a hundred men, with their 
horses and arms, to her court this night.&nbsp; And thou shalt 
remain her captive, unless she wish to take thy 
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this he did forthwith.&nbsp; And that 
night the maiden was right joyful, and they fared 
plenteously.</p>
<p>And the next day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and that 
day he vanquished a multitude of the host.&nbsp; And at the close
of the day, there came a proud and stately knight, and Peredur 
overthrew him, and he besought his mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who art 
thou?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Steward of the 
Palace,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how much of the 
maiden&rsquo;s possessions are under thy control?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;One third part,&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;thou shalt fully 
restore to the maiden her possessions, and, moreover, thou shalt 
give her meat and drink for two hundred men, and their horses and
their arms.&nbsp; And for thyself, thou shalt be her 
captive.&rdquo;&nbsp; And immediately it was so done.</p>
<p>And the third day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and he 
vanquished more that day than on either of the preceding.&nbsp; 
And at the close of the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>day, an earl came to encounter him, 
and he overthrew him, and he besought his mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
art thou?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the earl,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not conceal it from 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Peredur, 
&ldquo;thou shalt restore the whole of the maiden&rsquo;s 
earldom, and shalt give her thine own earldom in addition 
thereto, and meat and drink for three hundred men, and their 
horses and arms, and thou thyself shalt remain in her 
power.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus it was fulfilled.&nbsp; And Peredur 
tarried three weeks in the country, causing tribute and obedience
to be paid to the maiden, and the government to be placed in her 
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;With thy leave,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I
will go hence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, my brother, desirest 
thou this?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, by my faith; and had it not 
been for love of thee, I should not have been here thus 
long.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My soul,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;who 
art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am Peredur the son of Evrawc from
the North; and if ever thou art in trouble or in danger, acquaint
me therewith, and if I can, I will protect thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Peredur rode forth.&nbsp; And far thence there met him a 
lady, mounted on a horse that was lean, and covered with sweat; 
and she saluted the youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence comest thou, my 
sister?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she told him the cause of her 
journey.&nbsp; Now she was the wife of the Lord of the 
Glade.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am the 
knight through whom thou art in trouble, and he shall repent it, 
who has treated thee thus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon, behold a 
knight rode up, and he enquired of Peredur, if he had seen a 
knight such as he was seeking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold thy 
peace,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I am he whom thou seekest; and
by my faith, thou deservest ill of thy household for thy 
treatment of the maiden, for she is innocent concerning 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>they encountered, and they were not 
long in combat ere Peredur overthrew the knight, and he besought 
his mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy thou shalt have,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;so thou wilt return by the way thou camest, and 
declare that thou holdest the maiden innocent, and so that thou 
wilt acknowledge unto her the reverse thou hast sustained at my 
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the knight plighted him his faith 
thereto.</p>
<p>Then Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And above him he beheld a 
castle, and thitherward he went.&nbsp; And he struck upon the 
gate with his lance, and then, behold a comely auburn-haired 
youth opened the gate, and he had the stature of a warrior, and 
the years of a boy.&nbsp; And when Peredur came into the hall, 
there was a tall and stately lady sitting in a chair, and many 
handmaidens around her; and the lady rejoiced at his 
coming.&nbsp; And when it was time, they went to meat.&nbsp; And 
after their repast was finished, &ldquo;It were well for thee, 
chieftain,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to go elsewhere to 
sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore can I not sleep here?&rdquo;
said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nine sorceresses are here, my soul, of
the sorceresses of Gloucester, and their father and their mother 
are with them; and unless we can make our escape before daybreak,
we shall be slain; and already they have conquered and laid waste
all the country, except this one dwelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I will remain here 
to-night, and if you are in trouble, I will do you what service I
can; but harm shall you not receive from me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they
went to rest.&nbsp; And with the break of day, Peredur heard a 
dreadful outcry.&nbsp; And he hastily arose, and went forth in 
his vest and his doublet, with his sword about his neck, and he 
saw a sorceress overtake one of the watch, who cried out 
violently.&nbsp; Peredur attacked the sorceress, and struck her 
upon <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>the head with his sword, so that he flattened her helmet
and her headpiece like a dish upon her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy 
mercy, goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, and the mercy of 
Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How knowest thou, hag, that I am 
Peredur?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By destiny, and the foreknowledge 
that I should suffer harm from thee.&nbsp; And thou shalt take a 
horse and armour of me; and with me thou shalt go to learn 
chivalry and the use of thy arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Peredur, 
&ldquo;Thou shalt have mercy, if thou pledge thy faith thou wilt 
never more injure the dominions of the Countess.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Peredur took surety of this, and with permission of the Countess,
he set forth with the sorceress to the palace of the 
sorceresses.&nbsp; And there he remained for three weeks, and 
then he made choice of a horse and arms, and went his way.</p>
<p>And in the evening he entered a valley, and at the head of the
valley he came to a hermit&rsquo;s cell, and the hermit welcomed 
him gladly, and there he spent the night.&nbsp; And in the 
morning he arose, and when he went forth, behold a shower of snow
had fallen the night before, and a hawk had killed a wild fowl in
front of the cell.&nbsp; And the noise of the horse scared the 
hawk away, and a raven alighted upon the bird.&nbsp; And Peredur 
stood, and compared the blackness of the raven, and whiteness of 
the snow, and the redness of the blood, to the hair of the lady 
that best he loved, which was blacker than jet, and to her skin 
which was whiter than the snow, and to the two red spots upon her
cheeks, which were redder than the blood upon the snow appeared 
to be.</p>
<p>Now Arthur and his household were in search of Peredur.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Know ye,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;who is the knight with
the long spear that stands by the brook <a 
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72" 
class="citation">[72]</a> <!-- page 73--><a 
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>up 
yonder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said one of them, 
&ldquo;I will go and learn who he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the youth 
came to the place where Peredur was, and asked him what he did 
thus, and who he was.&nbsp; And from the intensity with which he 
thought upon the lady whom best he loved, he gave him no 
answer.&nbsp; Then the youth thrust at Peredur with his lance, 
and Peredur turned upon him, and struck him over his 
horse&rsquo;s crupper to the ground.&nbsp; And after this, four 
and twenty youths came to him, and he did not answer one more 
than another, but gave the same reception to all, bringing them 
with one single thrust to the ground.&nbsp; And then came Kai, 
and spoke to Peredur rudely and angrily; and Peredur took him 
with his lance under the jaw, and cast him from him with a 
thrust, so that he broke his arm and his shoulder blade, and he 
rode over him one and twenty times.&nbsp; And while he lay thus, 
stunned with the violence of the pain that he had suffered, his 
horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace.&nbsp; And when 
the household saw the horse come back without his rider, they 
rode forth in haste to the place where the encounter had 
been.&nbsp; And when they first came there, they thought that Kai
was slain; but they found that if he had a skilful physician, he 
yet might live.&nbsp; And Peredur moved not from his meditation, 
on seeing the concourse that was around Kai.&nbsp; And Kai was 
brought to Arthur&rsquo;s tent, and Arthur caused skilful 
physicians to come to him.&nbsp; And Arthur was grieved that Kai 
had met with this reverse, for he loved him greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;it is not fitting 
that any should disturb an honourable knight from his thought 
unadvisedly; for either he is pondering some damage that he has 
sustained, or he is thinking of the lady <!-- page 74--><a 
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>whom best he 
loves.&nbsp; And through such ill-advised proceeding, perchance 
this misadventure has befallen him who last met with him.&nbsp; 
And if it seem well to thee, lord, I will go and see if this 
knight has changed from his thought; and if he has, I will ask 
him courteously to come and visit thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Kai was
wrath, and he spoke angry and spiteful words.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Gwalchmai,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know that thou wilt 
bring him because he is fatigued.&nbsp; Little praise and honour,
nevertheless, wilt thou have from vanquishing a weary knight, who
is tired with fighting.&nbsp; Yet, thus hast thou gained the 
advantage over many.&nbsp; And while thy speech and thy soft 
words last, a coat of thin linen were armour sufficient for thee,
and thou wilt not need to break either lance or sword in fighting
with the knight in the state he is in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said 
Gwalchmai to Kai, &ldquo;Thou mightest use more pleasant words, 
wert thou so minded; and it behoves thee not upon me to wreak thy
wrath and thy displeasure.&nbsp; Methinks I shall bring the 
knight hither with me without breaking either my arm or my 
shoulder.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Arthur to Gwalchmai, &ldquo;Thou
speakest like a wise and a prudent man; go and take enough of 
armour about thee, and choose thy horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
Gwalchmai accoutred himself, and rode forward hastily to the 
place where Peredur was.</p>
<p>And Peredur was resting on the shaft of his spear, pondering 
the same thought, and Gwalchmai came to him without any signs of 
hostility, and said to him, &ldquo;If I thought that it would be 
as agreeable to thee as it would be to me, I would converse with 
thee.&nbsp; I have also a message from Arthur unto thee, to pray 
thee to come and visit him.&nbsp; And two men have been before on
this errand.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;and uncourteously they came.&nbsp; They attacked 
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
75</span>me, and I was annoyed thereat, for it was not pleasing 
to me to be drawn from the thought that I was in, for I was 
thinking of the lady whom best I love; and thus was she brought 
to my mind,&mdash;I was looking upon the snow, and upon the 
raven, and upon the drops of the blood of the bird that the hawk 
had killed upon the snow.&nbsp; And I bethought me that her 
whiteness was like that of the snow, and that the blackness of 
her hair and her eyebrows was like that of the raven, and that 
the two red spots upon her cheeks were like the two drops of 
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;This was not an 
ungentle thought, and I should marvel if it were pleasant to thee
to be drawn from it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;is Kai in Arthur&rsquo;s Court?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and behold he is the knight 
that fought with thee last; and it would have been better for him
had he not come, for his arm and his shoulder blade were broken 
with the fall which he had from thy spear.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;I am not sorry to have
thus begun to avenge the insult to the dwarf and 
dwarfess.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Gwalchmai marvelled to hear him speak
of the dwarf and the dwarfess; and he approached him, and threw 
his arms around his neck, and asked him what was his name.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Peredur the son of Evrawc am I called,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;and thou?&nbsp; Who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am 
called Gwalchmai,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am right glad
to meet with thee,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;for in every 
country where I have been, I have heard of thy fame for prowess 
and uprightness, and I solicit thy fellowship.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thou shall have it, by my faith, and grant me 
thine,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly will I do so,&rdquo; 
answered Peredur.</p>
<p>So they rode forth together joyfully towards the place where 
Arthur was; and when Kai saw them <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>coming, he 
said, &ldquo;I knew that Gwalchmai needed not to fight the 
knight.&nbsp; And it is no wonder that he should gain fame; more 
can he do by his fair words, than I by the strength of my 
arm.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peredur went with Gwalchmai to his tent, 
and they took off their armour.&nbsp; And Peredur put on garments
like those that Gwalchmai wore; and they went together unto 
Arthur, and saluted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, lord,&rdquo; said 
Gwalchmai, &ldquo;him whom thou hast sought so long.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Welcome unto thee, chieftain,&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;With me thou shalt remain; and had I known thy valour <a 
name="citation76"></a><a href="#footnote76" 
class="citation">[76]</a> had been such, thou shouldst not have 
left me as thou didst.&nbsp; Nevertheless, this was predicted of 
thee by the dwarf and the dwarfess, whom Kai ill treated, and 
whom thou hast avenged.&rdquo;&nbsp; And hereupon, behold there 
came the Queen and her handmaidens, and Peredur saluted 
them.&nbsp; And they were rejoiced to see him, and bade him 
welcome.&nbsp; And Arthur did him great honour and respect, and 
they returned towards Caerlleon.</p>
<p>And the first night, Peredur came to Caerlleon, to 
Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and as he walked in the city after his 
repast, behold, there met him Angharad Law Eurawc.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;By my faith, sister,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;thou art 
a beauteous and lovely maiden; and were it pleasing to thee, I 
could love thee above all women.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I pledge my 
faith,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I do not love thee, nor will 
I ever do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I also pledge my faith,&rdquo; 
said Peredur, &ldquo;that I will never speak a word to any 
Christian again, until thou come to love me above all 
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, Peredur went forth by the high road, along a 
mountain ridge, and he saw a valley of a circular form, the 
confines of which were rocky and <!-- page 77--><a 
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>wooded.&nbsp;
And the flat part of the valley was in meadows, and there were 
fields betwixt the meadows and the wood.&nbsp; And in the bosom 
of the wood he saw large black houses, of uncouth 
workmanship.&nbsp; And he dismounted, and led his horse towards 
the wood.&nbsp; And a little way within the wood he saw a rocky 
ledge, along which the road lay.&nbsp; And upon the ledge was a 
lion bound by a chain, and sleeping.&nbsp; And beneath the lion 
he saw a deep pit, of immense size, full of the bones of men and 
animals.&nbsp; And Peredur drew his sword, and struck the lion, 
so that he fell into the mouth of the pit, and hung there by the 
chain; and with a second blow he struck the chain, and broke it, 
and the lion fell into the pit, and Peredur led his horse over 
the rocky ledge, until he came into the valley.&nbsp; And in the 
centre of the valley he saw a fair castle, and he went towards 
it.&nbsp; And in the meadow by the Castle he beheld a huge grey 
man sitting, who was larger than any man he had ever before 
seen.&nbsp; And two young pages were shooting the hilts of their 
daggers, of the bone of the sea horse.&nbsp; And one of the pages
had red hair, and the other auburn.&nbsp; And they went before 
him to the place where the grey man was.&nbsp; And Peredur 
saluted him.&nbsp; And the grey man said, &ldquo;Disgrace to the 
beard of my porter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Peredur understood that the
porter was the lion.&nbsp; And the grey man and the pages went 
together into the Castle, and Peredur accompanied them; and he 
found it a fair and noble place.&nbsp; And they proceeded to the 
hall, and the tables were already laid, and upon them was 
abundance of food and liquor.&nbsp; And thereupon he saw an aged 
woman and a young woman come from the chamber; and they were the 
most stately women he had ever seen.&nbsp; Then they washed, and 
went to meat, and the grey <!-- page 78--><a 
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>man sat in 
the upper seat at the head of the table, and the aged woman next 
to him.&nbsp; And Peredur and the maiden were placed together; 
and the two young pages served them.&nbsp; And the maiden gazed 
sorrowfully upon Peredur, and Peredur asked the maiden wherefore 
she was sad.&nbsp; &ldquo;For thee, my soul; for, from when I 
first beheld thee, I have loved thee above all men.&nbsp; And it 
pains me to know that so gentle a youth as thou should have such 
a doom as awaits thee to-morrow.&nbsp; Sawest thou the numerous 
black houses in the bosom of the wood.&nbsp; All these belong to 
the vassals of the grey man yonder, who is my father.&nbsp; And 
they are all giants.&nbsp; And to-morrow they will rise up 
against thee, and will slay thee.&nbsp; And the Round Valley is 
this valley called.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen, fair maiden, wilt
thou contrive that my horse and arms be in the same lodging with 
me to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly will I cause it so to be,
by Heaven, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when it was time for them to sleep rather than to carouse,
they went to rest.&nbsp; And the maiden caused Peredur&rsquo;s 
horse and arms to be in the same lodging with him.&nbsp; And the 
next morning Peredur heard a great tumult of men and horses 
around the Castle.&nbsp; And Peredur arose, and armed himself and
his horse, and went to the meadow.&nbsp; Then the aged woman and 
the maiden came to the grey man, &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said they, 
&ldquo;take the word of the youth, that he will never disclose 
what he has seen in this place, and we will be his sureties that 
he keep it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not do so, by my 
faith,&rdquo; said the grey man.&nbsp; So Peredur fought with the
host; and towards evening, he had slain the one-third of them 
without receiving any hurt himself.&nbsp; Then said the aged 
woman, &ldquo;Behold, many of thy host have been slain by the 
youth.&nbsp; <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Do thou, therefore, grant him 
mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not grant it, by my 
faith,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; And the aged woman and the fair 
maiden were upon the battlements of the Castle, looking 
forth.&nbsp; And at that juncture, Peredur encountered the 
yellow-haired youth, and slew him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said
the maiden, &ldquo;grant the young man mercy.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That will I not do, by Heaven,&rdquo; he replied; and 
thereupon Peredur attacked the auburn-haired youth, and slew him 
likewise.&nbsp; &ldquo;It were better thou hadst accorded mercy 
to the youth, before he had slain thy two sons; for now scarcely 
wilt thou thyself escape from him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, 
maiden, and beseech the youth to grant mercy unto us, for we 
yield ourselves into his hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the maiden came 
to the place where Peredur was, and besought mercy for her 
father, and for all such of his vassals as had escaped 
alive.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou shalt have it, on condition that thy 
father, and all that are under him, go and render homage to 
Arthur, and tell him that it was his vassal Peredur that did him 
this service.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This will we do willingly, by 
Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you shall also receive baptism; 
and I will send to Arthur, and beseech him to bestow this valley 
upon thee, and upon thy heirs after thee for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then they went in, and the grey man and the tall woman saluted 
Peredur.&nbsp; And the grey man said unto him, &ldquo;Since I 
have possessed this valley, I have not seen any Christian depart 
with his life, save thyself.&nbsp; And we will go to do homage to
Arthur, and to embrace the faith, and be baptized.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Then said Peredur, &ldquo;To Heaven I render thanks that I have 
not broken my vow to the lady that best I love, which was, that I
would not speak one word unto any Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night they tarried there.&nbsp; And the next day, in the 
morning, the grey man, with his company, set <!-- page 80--><a 
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>forth to 
Arthur&rsquo;s Court; and they did homage unto Arthur, and he 
caused them to be baptized.&nbsp; And the grey man told Arthur, 
that it was Peredur that had vanquished them.&nbsp; And Arthur 
gave the valley to the grey man and his company, to hold it of 
him as Peredur had besought.&nbsp; And with Arthur&rsquo;s 
permission, the grey man went back to the Round Valley.</p>
<p>Peredur rode forward next day, and he traversed a vast tract 
of desert, in which no dwellings were.&nbsp; And at length he 
came to a habitation, mean and small.&nbsp; And there he heard 
that there was a serpent that lay upon a gold ring, and suffered 
none to inhabit the country for seven miles around.&nbsp; And 
Peredur came to the place where he heard the serpent was.&nbsp; 
And angrily, furiously, and desperately, fought he with the 
serpent; and at the last he killed it, and took away the 
ring.&nbsp; And thus he was for a long time without speaking a 
word to any Christian.&nbsp; And therefrom he lost his colour and
his aspect, through extreme longing after the Court of Arthur, 
and the society of the lady whom best he loved, and of his 
companions.&nbsp; Then he proceeded forward to Arthur&rsquo;s 
Court, and on the road there met him Arthur&rsquo;s household, 
going on a particular errand, with Kai at their head.&nbsp; And 
Peredur knew them all, but none of the household recognised 
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whence comest thou, chieftain?&rdquo; said 
Kai.&nbsp; And this he asked him twice, and three times, and he 
answered him not.&nbsp; And Kai thrust him through the thigh with
his lance.&nbsp; And lest he should be compelled to speak, and to
break his vow, he went on without stopping.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;I declare to Heaven, 
Kai, that thou hast acted ill in committing such an outrage on a 
youth like this, who cannot speak.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Gwalchmai 
returned back <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to Arthur&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he to Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;seest thou how 
wicked an outrage Kai has committed upon this youth who cannot 
speak; for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, and for mine, cause him to have 
medical care before I come back, and I will repay thee the 
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before the men returned from their errand, a knight came 
to the meadow beside Arthur&rsquo;s Palace, to dare some one to 
the encounter.&nbsp; And his challenge was accepted; and Peredur 
fought with him, and overthrew him.&nbsp; And for a week he 
overthrew one knight every day.</p>
<p>And one day, Arthur and his household were going to Church, 
and they beheld a knight who had raised the signal for 
combat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;by the 
valour of men, I will not go hence until I have my horse and my 
arms to overthrow yonder boor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then went the 
attendants to fetch Arthur&rsquo;s horse and arms.&nbsp; And 
Peredur met the attendants as they were going back, and he took 
the horse and arms from them, and proceeded to the meadow; and 
all those who saw him arise and go to do battle with the knight, 
went upon the tops of the houses, and the mounds, and the high 
places, to behold the combat.&nbsp; And Peredur beckoned with his
hand to the knight to commence the fight.&nbsp; And the knight 
thrust at him, but he was not thereby moved from where he 
stood.&nbsp; And Peredur spurred his horse, and ran at him 
wrathfully, furiously, fiercely, desperately, and with mighty 
rage, and he gave him a thrust, deadly-wounding, severe, furious,
adroit and strong, under his jaw, and raised him out of his 
saddle, and cast him a long way from him.&nbsp; And Peredur went 
back, and left the horse and the arms with the attendant as 
before, and he went on foot to the Palace.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
82</span>Then Peredur went by the name of the Dumb Youth.&nbsp; 
And behold, Angharad Law Eurawc met him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare 
to Heaven, chieftain,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;woeful is it that 
thou canst not speak; for couldst thou speak, I would love thee 
best of all men; and, by my faith, although thou canst not, I do 
love thee above all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee, my 
sister,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;by my faith, I also do love 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon it was known that he was 
Peredur.&nbsp; And then he held fellowship with Gwalchmai, and 
Owain the son of Urien, and all the household, and he remained in
Arthur&rsquo;s Court.</p>
<p>Arthur was in Caerlleon upon Usk; and he went to hunt, and 
Peredur went with him.&nbsp; And Peredur let loose his dog upon a
hart, and the dog killed the hart in a desert place.&nbsp; And a 
short space from him he saw signs of a dwelling, and towards the 
dwelling he went, and he beheld a hall, and at the door of the 
hall he found bald swarthy youths playing at chess.&nbsp; And 
when he entered, he beheld three maidens sitting on a bench, and 
they were all clothed alike, as became persons of high 
rank.&nbsp; And he came, and sat by them upon the bench; and one 
of the maidens looked steadfastly upon Peredur, and wept.&nbsp; 
And Peredur asked her wherefore she was weeping.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Through grief, that I should see so fair a youth as thou 
art, slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who will slay me?&rdquo; enquired
Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou art so daring as to remain here 
to-night, I will tell thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How great soever 
my danger may be from remaining here, I will listen unto 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This Palace is owned by him who is my 
father,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;and he slays every one who
comes hither without his leave.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What sort of 
a man is thy father, that he is able to slay every one 
thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
83</span>&ldquo;A man who does violence and wrong unto his 
neighbours, and who renders justice unto none.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
hereupon he saw the youths arise and clear the chessmen from the 
board.&nbsp; And he heard a great tumult; and after the tumult 
there came in a huge black one-eyed man, and the maidens arose to
meet him.&nbsp; And they disarrayed him, and he went and sat 
down; and after he had rested and pondered awhile, he looked at 
Peredur, and asked who the knight was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; 
said one of the maidens, &ldquo;he is the fairest and gentlest 
youth that ever thou didst see.&nbsp; And for the sake of Heaven,
and of thine own dignity, have patience with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;For thy sake I will have patience, and I will grant him 
his life this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Peredur came towards them 
to the fire, and partook of food and liquor, and entered into 
discourse with the ladies.&nbsp; And being elated with the 
liquor, he said to the black man, &ldquo;It is a marvel to me, so
mighty as thou sayest thou art, who could have put out thine 
eye?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is one of my habits,&rdquo; said the 
black man, &ldquo;that whosoever puts to me the question which 
thou hast asked, shall not escape with his life, either as a free
gift, or for a price.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the 
maiden, &ldquo;whatsoever he may say to thee in jest, and through
the excitement of liquor, make good that which thou saidest and 
didst promise me just now.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do so, 
gladly, for thy sake,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Willingly will
I grant him his life this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that night thus
they remained.</p>
<p>And the next day the black man got up, and put on his armour, 
and said to Peredur, &ldquo;Arise, man, and suffer 
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peredur said unto him, &ldquo;Do one of 
two things, black man; if thou wilt fight with me, either throw 
off thy own armour, or give arms to me, that I may encounter 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! man,&rdquo; said he, <!-- page 
84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
84</span>&ldquo;couldst thou fight, if thou hadst arms?&nbsp; 
Take, then, what arms thou dost choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
thereupon the maiden came to Peredur with such arms as pleased 
him; and he fought with the black man, and forced him to crave 
his mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Black man, thou shalt have mercy, 
provided thou tell me who thou art, and who put out thine 
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, I will tell thee, I lost it in 
fighting with the Black Serpent of the Carn.&nbsp; There is a 
mound, which is called the Mound of Mourning; and on the mound 
there is a earn, and in the earn there is a serpent, and on the 
tail of the serpent there is a stone, and the virtues of the 
stone are such, that whosoever should hold it in one hand, in the
other he will have as much gold as he may desire.&nbsp; And in 
fighting with this serpent was it that I lost my eye.&nbsp; And 
the Black Oppressor am I called.&nbsp; And for this reason I am 
called the Black Oppressor, that there is not a single man around
me whom I have not oppressed, and justice have I done unto 
none.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;how
far is it hence?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The same day that thou 
settest forth, thou wilt come to the Palace of the Sons of the 
King of the Tortures.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore are they 
called thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Addanc of the Lake slays 
them once every day.&nbsp; When thou goest thence, thou wilt come
to the Court of the Countess of the Achievements.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What achievements are there?&rdquo; asked Peredur.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Three hundred men there are in her household, and unto 
every stranger that comes to the Court, the achievements of her 
household are related.&nbsp; And this is the manner of 
it,&mdash;the three hundred men of the household sit next unto 
the Lady; and that not through disrespect unto the guests, but 
that they may relate the achievements of the household.&nbsp; And
the day that thou goest thence, thou wilt reach the Mound of 
Mourning, and round <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>about the mound there are the owners 
of three hundred tents guarding the serpent.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Since thou hast, indeed, been an oppressor so long,&rdquo;
said Peredur, &ldquo;I will cause that thou continue so no 
longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he slew him.</p>
<p>Then the maiden spoke, and began to converse with him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;If thou wast poor when thou camest here, henceforth thou 
wilt be rich through the treasure of the black man whom thou hast
slain.&nbsp; Thou seest the many lovely maidens that there are in
this Court, thou shalt have her whom thou best likest for the 
lady of thy love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady, I came not hither 
from my country to woo; but match yourselves as it liketh you 
with the comely youths I see here; and none of your goods do I 
desire, for I need them not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Peredur rode 
forward, and he came to the Palace of the Sons of the King of the
Tortures; and when he entered the Palace, he saw none but women; 
and they rose up, and were joyful at his coming; and as they 
began to discourse with him, he beheld a charger arrive, with a 
saddle upon it, and a corpse in the saddle.&nbsp; And one of the 
women arose, and took the corpse from the saddle, and anointed it
in a vessel of warm water, which was below the door, and placed 
precious balsam upon it; and the man rose up alive, and came to 
the place where Peredur was, and greeted him, and was joyful to 
see him.&nbsp; And two other men came in upon their saddles, and 
the maiden treated these two in the same manner as she had done 
the first.&nbsp; Then Peredur asked the chieftain wherefore it 
was thus.&nbsp; And they told him, that there was an Addanc in a 
cave, which slew them once every day.&nbsp; And thus they 
remained that night.</p>
<p>And next morning the youths arose to sally forth, and Peredur 
besought them, for the sake of the ladies <!-- page 86--><a 
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>of their 
love, to permit him to go with them; but they refused him, 
saying, &ldquo;If thou shouldst be slain there, thou hast none to
bring thee back to life again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they rode 
forward, and Peredur followed after them; and after they had 
disappeared out of his sight, he came to a mound, whereon sat the
fairest lady he had ever beheld.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know thy 
quest,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;thou art going to encounter the 
Addanc, and he will slay thee, and that not by courage, but by 
craft.&nbsp; He has a cave, and at the entrance of the cave there
is a stone pillar, and he sees every one that enters, and none 
see him; and from behind the pillar he slays every one with a 
poisonous dart.&nbsp; And if thou wouldst pledge me thy faith, to
love me above all women, I would give thee a stone, by which thou
shouldst see him when thou goest in, and he should not see 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, by my troth,&rdquo; said 
Peredur, &ldquo;for when first I beheld thee, I loved thee; and 
where shall I seek thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When thou seekest 
me, seek towards India.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the maiden vanished, 
after placing the stone in Peredur&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and 
the borders of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the 
river were level meadows.&nbsp; And on one side of the river he 
saw a flock of white sheep, and on the other a flock of black 
sheep.&nbsp; And whenever one of the white sheep bleated, one of 
the black sheep would cross over, and become white; and when one 
of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would cross 
over, and become black.&nbsp; And he saw a tall tree by the side 
of the river, one half of which was in flames from the root to 
the top, and the other half was green and in full leaf.&nbsp; And
nigh thereto he saw a youth sitting upon a mound, and two 
greyhounds, white-breasted, and spotted, in leashes, <!-- page 
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>lying
by his side.&nbsp; And certain was he, that he had never seen a 
youth of so royal a bearing as he.&nbsp; And in the wood opposite
he heard hounds raising a herd of deer.&nbsp; And Peredur saluted
the youth, and the youth greeted him in return.&nbsp; And there 
were three roads leading from the mound; two of them were wide 
roads, and the third was more narrow.&nbsp; And Peredur enquired 
where the three roads went.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of them goes to my 
palace,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and one of two things I 
counsel thee to do, either to proceed to my palace, which is 
before thee, and where thou wilt find my wife, or else to remain 
here to see the hounds chasing the roused deer from the wood to 
the plain.&nbsp; And thou shall see the best greyhounds thou 
didst ever behold, and the boldest in the chase, kill them by the
water beside us; and when it is time to go to meat, my page will 
come with my horse to meet me, and thou shalt rest in my palace 
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven reward thee; but I cannot 
tarry, for onward must I go.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The other road 
leads to the town, which is near here, and wherein food and 
liquor may be bought; and the road which is narrower than the 
others goes towards the cave of the Addanc.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;With thy permission, young man, I will go that 
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Peredur went towards the cave.&nbsp; And he took the stone
in his left hand, and his lance in his right.&nbsp; And as he 
went in, he perceived the Addanc, and he pierced him through with
his lance, and cut off his head.&nbsp; And as he came from the 
cave, behold the three companions were at the entrance; and they 
saluted Peredur, and told him that there was a prediction that he
should slay that monster.&nbsp; And Peredur gave the head to the 
young men, and they offered him in marriage whichever of the 
three sisters <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>he might choose, and half their 
kingdom with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came not hither to woo,&rdquo; 
said Peredur, &ldquo;but if peradventure I took a wife, I should 
prefer your sister to all others.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peredur rode 
forward, and he heard a noise behind him.&nbsp; And he looked 
back, and saw a man upon a red horse, with red armour upon him; 
and the man rode up by his side, and saluted him, and wished him 
the favour of Heaven and of man.&nbsp; And Peredur greeted the 
youth kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord, I come to make a request unto 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What wouldest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That thou shouldest take me as thine 
attendant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who then should I take as my 
attendant, if I did so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not conceal 
from thee what kindred I am of.&nbsp; Etlym Gleddyv Coch am I 
called, an Earl from the East Country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
marvel that thou shouldest offer to become attendant to a man 
whose possessions are no greater than thine own; for I have but 
an earldom like thyself.&nbsp; But since thou desirest to be my 
attendant, I will take thee joyfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went forward to the Court of the Countess, and all 
they of the Court were glad at their coming; and they were told 
it was not through disrespect they were placed below the 
household, but that such was the usage of the Court.&nbsp; For, 
whoever should overthrow the three hundred men of her household, 
would sit next the Countess, and she would love him above all 
men.&nbsp; And Peredur having overthrown the three hundred men of
her household, sat down beside her, and the Countess said, 
&ldquo;I thank Heaven that I have a youth so fair and so valiant 
as thou, since I have not obtained the man whom best I 
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is he whom best thou 
lovest?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By my faith, Etlym Gleddyv Coch is 
the man whom I love best, and I have never seen him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of a truth, Etlym is my <!-- page 89--><a 
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>companion; 
and behold here he is, and for his sake did I come to joust with 
thy household.&nbsp; And he could have done so better than I, had
it pleased him.&nbsp; And I do give thee unto him.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Heaven reward thee, fair youth, and I will take the man 
whom I love above all others.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Countess 
became Etlym&rsquo;s bride from that moment.</p>
<p>And the next day Peredur set forth towards the Mound of 
Mourning.&nbsp; &ldquo;By thy hand, lord, but I will go with 
thee,&rdquo; said Etlym.&nbsp; Then they went forwards till they 
came in sight of the mound and the tents.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go unto 
yonder men,&rdquo; said Peredur to Etlym, &ldquo;and desire them 
to come and do me homage.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Etlym went unto them, 
and said unto them thus&mdash;&ldquo;Come and do homage to my 
lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is thy lord?&rdquo; said 
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peredur with the long lance is my lord,&rdquo;
said Etlym.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were it permitted to slay a messenger, 
thou shouldest not go back to thy lord alive, for making unto 
Kings, and Earls, and Barons, so arrogant a demand as to go and 
do him homage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peredur desired him to go back to 
them, and to give them their choice, either to do him homage or 
to do battle with him.&nbsp; And they chose rather to do 
battle.&nbsp; And that day Peredur overthrew the owners of a 
hundred tents.&nbsp; And the next day he overthrew the owners of 
a hundred more; and the third day the remaining hundred took 
counsel to do homage to Peredur.&nbsp; And Peredur enquired of 
them, wherefore they were there.&nbsp; And they told him they 
were guarding the serpent until he should die.&nbsp; &ldquo;For 
then should we fight for the stone among ourselves, and whoever 
should be conqueror among us would have the stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Await here,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;and I will go to 
encounter the serpent.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so, lord,&rdquo; 
said they, &ldquo;we will go altogether to encounter the 
serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
90</span>&ldquo;Verily,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;that will I 
not permit; for if the serpent be slain, I shall derive no more 
fame therefrom than one of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he went to the 
place where the serpent was, and slew it, and came back to them, 
and said, &ldquo;Reckon up what you have spent since you have 
been here, and I will repay you to the full.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he 
paid to each what he said was his claim.&nbsp; And he required of
them only that they should acknowledge themselves his 
vassals.&nbsp; And he said to Etlym, &ldquo;Go back unto her whom
thou lovest best, and I will go forwards, and I will reward thee 
for having been my attendant.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he gave Etlym the 
stone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven repay thee and prosper thee,&rdquo; 
said Etlym.</p>
<p>And Peredur rode thence, and he came to the fairest valley he 
had ever seen, through which ran a river; and there he beheld 
many tents of various colours.&nbsp; And he marvelled still more 
at the number of water-mills and of wind-mills that he saw.&nbsp;
And there rode up with him a tall auburn-haired man, in a 
workman&rsquo;s garb, and Peredur enquired of him who he 
was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the chief miller,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;of all the mills yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou 
give me lodging?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, 
gladly,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; And Peredur came to the 
miller&rsquo;s house, and the miller had a fair and pleasant 
dwelling.&nbsp; And Peredur asked money as a loan from the 
miller, that he might buy meat and liquor for himself, and for 
the household, and he promised that he would pay him again ere he
went thence.&nbsp; And he enquired of the miller, wherefore such 
a multitude were there assembled.&nbsp; Said the miller to 
Peredur, &ldquo;One thing is certain; either thou art a man from 
afar, or thou art beside thyself.&nbsp; The Empress of 
Cristinobyl the Great is here; and she will have no one but the 
man who is most valiant; <!-- page 91--><a 
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>for riches 
does she not require.&nbsp; And it was impossible to bring food 
for so many thousands as are here, therefore were all these mills
constructed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that night they took their 
rest.</p>
<p>And the next day Peredur arose, and he equipped himself and 
his horse for the tournament.&nbsp; And among the other tents, he
beheld one, which was the fairest he had ever seen.&nbsp; And he 
saw a beauteous maiden leaning her head out of a window of the 
tent, and he had never seen a maiden more lovely than she.&nbsp; 
And upon her was a garment of satin.&nbsp; And he gazed fixedly 
on the maiden, and began to love her greatly.&nbsp; And he 
remained there, gazing upon the maiden from morning until 
mid-day, and from mid-day until evening; and then the tournament 
was ended; and he went to his lodging, and drew off his 
armour.&nbsp; Then he asked money of the miller as a loan, and 
the miller&rsquo;s wife was wroth with Peredur; nevertheless, the
miller lent him the money.&nbsp; And the next day he did in like 
manner as he had done the day before.&nbsp; And at night he came 
to his lodging, and took money as a loan from the miller.&nbsp; 
And the third day, as he was in the same place, gazing upon the 
maiden, he felt a hard blow between the neck and the shoulder, 
from the edge of an axe.&nbsp; And when he looked behind him, he 
saw that it was the miller; and the miller said to him, &ldquo;Do
one of two things: either turn thy head from hence, or go to the 
tournament.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peredur smiled on the miller, and 
went to the tournament; and all that encountered him that day, he
overthrew.&nbsp; And as many as he vanquished, he sent as a gift 
to the Empress, and their horses and arms he sent as a gift to 
the wife of the miller, in payment of the borrowed money.&nbsp; 
Peredur attended the tournament until all were overthrown, <!-- 
page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
92</span>and he sent all the men to the prison of the Empress, 
and the horses and arms to the wife of the miller, in payment of 
the borrowed money.&nbsp; And the Empress sent to the Knight of 
the Mill, to ask him to come and visit her.&nbsp; And Peredur 
went not for the first nor for the second message.&nbsp; And the 
third time she sent an hundred knights to bring him against his 
will, and they went to him, and told him their mission from the 
Empress.&nbsp; And Peredur fought well with them, and caused them
to be bound like stags, and thrown into the mill dyke.&nbsp; And 
the Empress sought advice of a wise man, who was in her counsel; 
and he said to her, &ldquo;With thy permission, I will go to him 
myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he came to Peredur, and saluted him, and 
besought him, for the sake of the lady of his love, to come and 
visit the Empress.&nbsp; And they went, together with the 
miller.&nbsp; And Peredur went and sat down in the outer chamber 
of the tent, and she came and placed herself by his side.&nbsp; 
And there was but little discourse between them.&nbsp; And 
Peredur took his leave, and went to his lodging.&nbsp; And the 
next day he came to visit her, and when he came into the tent, 
there was no one chamber less decorated than the others.&nbsp; 
And they knew not where he would sit.&nbsp; And Peredur went and 
sat beside the Empress, and discoursed with her 
courteously.&nbsp; And while they were thus, they beheld a black 
man enter with a goblet full of wine in his hand.&nbsp; And he 
dropped upon his knee before the Empress, and besought her to 
give it to no one who would not fight with him for it.&nbsp; And 
she looked upon Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;bestow on me the goblet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Peredur drank 
the wine, and gave the goblet to the miller&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; 
And while they were thus, behold there entered a black man, of 
larger stature than the <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>other, with a wild beast&rsquo;s claw
in his hand, wrought into the form of a goblet, and filled with 
wine.&nbsp; And he presented it to the Empress, and besought her 
to give it to no one but the man who would fight with him.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;bestow it on 
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she gave it to him.&nbsp; And Peredur drank 
the wine, and sent the goblet to the wife of the miller.&nbsp; 
And while they were thus, behold a rough-looking crisp-haired 
man, taller than either of the others, came in with a bowl in his
hand full of wine; and he bent upon his knee, and gave it into 
the hands of the Empress, and he besought her to give it to none 
but him who would fight with him for it; and she gave it to 
Peredur, and he sent it to the miller&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; And 
that night Peredur returned to his lodging; and the next day he 
accoutred himself and his horse, and went to the meadow, and slew
the three men.&nbsp; Then Peredur proceeded to the tent, and the 
Empress said to him, &ldquo;Goodly Peredur, remember the faith 
thou didst pledge me when I gave thee the stone, and thou didst 
kill the Addanc.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; answered he, 
&ldquo;thou sayest truth, I do remember it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
Peredur was entertained by the Empress fourteen years, as the 
story relates.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Arthur was at Caerlleon upon Usk, his principal palace; and in
the centre of the floor of the hall were four men sitting on a 
carpet of velvet, Owain the son of Urien, and Gwalchmai the son 
of Gwyar, and Howel the son of Emyr Llydaw, and Peredur of the 
long lance.&nbsp; And thereupon they saw a black curly-headed 
maiden enter, riding upon a yellow mule, with jagged thongs in 
her hand, to urge it on; and having a rough and hideous 
aspect.&nbsp; Blacker were her face and her two hands than the 
blackest iron covered <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>with pitch; and her hue was not more 
frightful than her form.&nbsp; High cheeks had she, and a face 
lengthened downwards, and a short nose with distended 
nostrils.&nbsp; And one eye was of a piercing mottled grey, and 
the other was as black as jet, deep sunk in her head.&nbsp; And 
her teeth were long and yellow, more yellow were they than the 
flower of the broom.&nbsp; And her stomach rose from the breast 
bone, higher than her chin.&nbsp; And her back was in the shape 
of a crook, and her legs were large and bony.&nbsp; And her 
figure was very thin and spare, except her feet and her legs, 
which were of huge size.&nbsp; And she greeted Arthur and all his
household, except Peredur.&nbsp; And to Peredur she spoke harsh 
and angry words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peredur, I greet thee not, seeing 
that thou dost not merit it.&nbsp; Blind was fate in giving thee 
fame and favour.&nbsp; When thou wast in the Court of the Lame 
King, and didst see there the youth bearing the streaming spear, 
from the points of which were drops of blood flowing in streams, 
even to the hand of the youth, and many other wonders likewise, 
thou didst not enquire their meaning nor their cause.&nbsp; Hadst
thou done so, the King would have been restored to health, and 
his dominions to peace.&nbsp; Whereas, from henceforth, he will 
have to endure battles and conflicts, and his knights will 
perish, and wives will be widowed, and maidens will be left 
portionless, and all this is because of thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then 
said she unto Arthur, &ldquo;May it please thee, lord, my 
dwelling is far hence, in the stately castle of which thou hast 
heard, and therein are five hundred and sixty-six knights of the 
order of Chivalry, and the lady whom best he loves with each; and
whoever would acquire fame in arms, and encounters, and 
conflicts, he will gain it there, if he deserve it.&nbsp; And 
whoso would reach the summit of fame and of honour, I <!-- page 
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>know 
where he may find it.&nbsp; There is a Castle on a lofty 
mountain, and there is a maiden therein, and she is detained a 
prisoner there, and whoever shall set her free will attain the 
summit of the fame of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon she 
rode away.</p>
<p>Said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;By my faith, I will not rest tranquilly
until I have proved if I can release the maiden.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
many of Arthur&rsquo;s household joined themselves with 
him.&nbsp; Then, likewise said Peredur, &ldquo;By my faith, I 
will not rest tranquilly until I know the story and meaning of 
the lance whereof the black maiden spoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while 
they were equipping themselves, behold a knight came to the 
gate.&nbsp; And he had the size and the strength of a warrior, 
and was equipped with arms and habiliments.&nbsp; And he went 
forward, and saluted Arthur and all his household, except 
Gwalchmai.&nbsp; And the knight had upon his shoulder a shield, 
ingrained with gold, with a fesse of azure blue upon it, and his 
whole armour was of the same hue.&nbsp; And he said to Gwalchmai,
&ldquo;Thou didst slay my lord, by thy treachery and deceit, and 
that will I prove upon thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Gwalchmai rose 
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is my gage 
against thee, to maintain either in this place, or wherever else 
thou wilt, that I am not a traitor or deceiver.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Before the King whom I obey, will I that my encounter with
thee take place,&rdquo; said the knight.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;go forward, and I
will follow thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the knight went forth, and 
Gwalchmai accoutred himself, and there was offered unto him 
abundance of armour, but he would take none but his own.&nbsp; 
And when Gwalchmai and Peredur were equipped, they set forth to 
follow him, by reason of their fellowship, and of the great 
friendship that was between them.&nbsp; And they did not go after
him <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
96</span>in company together, but each went his own way.</p>
<p>At the dawn of day, Gwalchmai came to a valley, and in the 
valley he saw a fortress, and within the fortress a vast palace, 
and lofty towers around it.&nbsp; And he beheld a knight coming 
out to hunt from the other side, mounted on a spirited black 
snorting palfrey, that advanced at a prancing pace, proudly 
stepping, and nimbly bounding, and sure of foot; and this was the
man to whom the palace belonged.&nbsp; And Gwalchmai saluted him,
&ldquo;Heaven prosper thee, chieftain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
whence comest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I come,&rdquo; answered 
he, &ldquo;from the Court of Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And art 
thou Arthur&rsquo;s vassal?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, by my 
faith,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give thee good 
counsel,&rdquo; said the knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see that thou art
tired and weary, go unto my palace, if it may please thee, and 
tarry there to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Willingly, lord,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and Heaven reward thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Take 
this ring as a token to the porter, and go forward to yonder 
tower, and therein thou wilt find my sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
Gwalchmai went to the gate, and shewed the ring, and proceeded to
the tower.&nbsp; And on entering, he beheld a large blazing fire,
burning without smoke, and with a bright and lofty flame, and a 
beauteous and stately maiden was sitting on a chair by the 
fire.&nbsp; And the maiden was glad at his coming, and welcomed 
him, and advanced to meet him.&nbsp; And he went and sat beside 
the maiden, and they took their repast.&nbsp; And when their 
repast was over, they discoursed pleasantly together.&nbsp; And 
while they were thus, behold there entered a venerable 
hoary-headed man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! base girl,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;if thou didst think that it was right for thee to 
entertain and to sit by yonder man; thou wouldest not do 
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he withdrew his head, and went forth, 
&ldquo;Ha! <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>chieftain,&rdquo; said the maiden, 
&ldquo;if thou wilt do as I counsel thee, thou wilt shut the 
door, lest the man should have a plot against thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Upon that Gwalchmai arose, and when he came near unto the door, 
the man, with sixty others, fully armed, were ascending the 
tower.&nbsp; And Gwalchmai defended the door with a chessboard, 
that none might enter until the man should return from the 
chase.&nbsp; And thereupon, behold the earl arrived.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; asked he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a 
sad thing,&rdquo; said the hoary-headed man, &ldquo;the young 
girl yonder has been sitting and eating with him who slew your 
father.&nbsp; He is Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Hold thy peace, then,&rdquo; said the earl, &ldquo;I will 
go in.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the earl was joyful concerning 
Gwalchmai.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! chieftain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it 
was wrong of thee to come to my Court, when thou knewest that 
thou didst slay my father; and though we cannot avenge him, 
Heaven will avenge him upon thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My 
soul,&rdquo; said Gwalchmai, &ldquo;thus it is; I came not here 
either to acknowledge or to deny having slain thy father; but I 
am on a message from Arthur, and therefore do I crave the space 
of a year until I shall return from my embassy, and then, upon my
faith, I will come back unto this palace, and do one of two 
things, either acknowledge it, or deny it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the 
time was granted him willingly; and he remained there that 
night.&nbsp; And the next morning he rode forth.&nbsp; And the 
story relates nothing further of Gwalchmai respecting this 
adventure.</p>
<p>And Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And he wandered over the whole
island, seeking tidings of the black maiden, and he could meet 
with none.&nbsp; And he came to an unknown land, in the centre of
a valley, watered by a river.&nbsp; And as he traversed the 
valley, he beheld a horseman coming towards him, and wearing the 
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
98</span>garments of a priest, and he besought his 
blessing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wretched man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;thou 
meritest no blessing, and thou wouldst not be profited by one, 
seeing that thou art clad in armour on such a day as 
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what day is to-day?&rdquo; said 
Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day is Good Friday,&rdquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chide me not, that I knew not this, seeing
that it is a year to-day since I journeyed forth from my 
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he dismounted, and led his horse in 
his hand.&nbsp; And he had not proceeded far along the high road 
before he came to a cross road, and the cross road traversed a 
wood.&nbsp; And on the other side of the wood he saw an 
unfortified castle, which appeared to be inhabited.&nbsp; And at 
the gate of the castle there met him the priest whom he had seen 
before, and he asked his blessing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blessing of 
Heaven be unto thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is more fitting to
travel in thy present guise, than as thou wast erewhile; and this
night thou shalt tarry with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he remained there
that night.</p>
<p>And the next day Peredur sought to go forth.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;To-day may no one journey.&nbsp; Thou shalt remain with me
to-day and to-morrow, and the day following, and I will direct 
thee as best I may to the place which thou art 
seeking.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the fourth day Peredur sought to go 
forth, and he entreated the priest to tell him how he should find
the Castle of Wonders.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I know thereof, I will 
tell thee,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go over yonder 
mountain, and on the other side of the mountain thou wilt come to
a river, and in the valley wherein the river runs is a 
King&rsquo;s Palace, wherein the King sojourned during 
Easter.&nbsp; And if thou mayest have tidings anywhere of the 
Castle of Wonders, thou wilt have them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Peredur rode forward.&nbsp; And he came to the valley in 
which was the river, and there met him a <!-- page 99--><a 
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>number of men
going to hunt, and in the midst of them was a man of exalted 
rank, and Peredur saluted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Choose, 
chieftain,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;whether thou wilt go with 
me to the chase, or wilt proceed to my Palace, and I will 
despatch one of my household to commend thee to my daughter, who 
is there, and who will entertain thee with food and liquor until 
I return from hunting; and whatever may be thine errand, such as 
I can obtain for thee, thou shalt gladly have.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
the King sent a little yellow page with him as an attendant; and 
when they came to the palace, the lady had arisen, and was about 
to wash before meat.&nbsp; Peredur went forward, and she saluted 
him joyfully, and placed him by her side.&nbsp; And they took 
their repast.&nbsp; And whatsoever Peredur said unto her, she 
laughed loudly, so that all in the palace could hear.&nbsp; Then 
spoke the yellow page to the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;By my 
faith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this youth is already thy husband; 
or if he be not, thy mind and thy thoughts are set upon 
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the little yellow page went unto the King, 
and told him that it seemed to him that the youth whom he had met
with was his daughter&rsquo;s husband, or if he were not so 
already, that he would shortly become so, unless he were 
cautious.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is thy counsel in this matter, 
youth?&rdquo; said the King.&nbsp; &ldquo;My counsel is,&rdquo; 
he replied, &ldquo;that thou set strong men upon him, to seize 
him, until thou hast ascertained the truth respecting 
this.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he set strong men upon Peredur, who seized 
him, and cast him into prison.&nbsp; And the maiden went before 
her father, and asked him, wherefore he had caused the youth from
Arthur&rsquo;s Court to be imprisoned.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 
truth,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;he shall not be free to-night, 
nor to-morrow, nor the day following, and he shall not come from 
where he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; She replied not to what the king <!-- 
page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
100</span>had said, but she went to the youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
unpleasant to thee to be here?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
should not care, if I were not,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Thy couch and thy treatment shall be in no wise inferior 
to that of the King himself, and thou shalt have the best 
entertainment that the palace affords.&nbsp; And if it were more 
pleasing to thee that my couch should be here, that I might 
discourse with thee, it should be so, cheerfully.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;This can I not refuse,&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; And he 
remained in prison that night.&nbsp; And the maiden provided all 
that she had promised him.</p>
<p>And the next day Peredur heard a tumult in the town.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Tell me, fair maiden, what is that tumult?&rdquo; said 
Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the King&rsquo;s hosts and his forces 
have come to the town to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what seek 
they here?&rdquo; he enquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is an Earl near
this place, who possesses two Earldoms, and is as powerful as a 
king; and an engagement will take place between them 
to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I beseech thee,&rdquo; said Peredur, 
&ldquo;to cause a horse and arms to be brought, that I may view 
the encounter, and I promise to come back to my prison 
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;will I
provide thee with horse and arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she gave him a 
horse and arms, and a bright scarlet robe of honour over his 
armour, and a yellow shield upon his shoulder.&nbsp; And he went 
to the combat; and as many of the Earl&rsquo;s men as encountered
him that day, he overthrew; and he returned to his prison.&nbsp; 
And the maiden asked tidings of Peredur, and he answered her not 
a word.&nbsp; And she went and asked tidings of her father, and 
enquired who had acquitted himself best of the household.&nbsp; 
And he said that he knew not, but that it was a man with a 
scarlet robe of honour over his armour, and a yellow shield upon 
his shoulder.&nbsp; Then she smiled, and returned to where <!-- 
page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
101</span>Peredur was, and did him great honour that night.&nbsp;
And for three days did Peredur slay the Earl&rsquo;s men; and 
before any one could know who he was, he returned to his 
prison.&nbsp; And the fourth day Peredur slew the Earl 
himself.&nbsp; And the maiden went unto her father, and enquired 
of him the news.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have good news for thee,&rdquo; 
said the King, &ldquo;the Earl is slain, and I am the owner of 
his two Earldoms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowest thou, lord, who 
slew him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the 
King.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the knight with the scarlet robe of 
honour, and the yellow shield.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; 
said she, &ldquo;I know who that is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By 
Heaven,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;who is he?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he is the knight whom 
thou hast imprisoned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he went unto Peredur, and
saluted him, and told him that he would reward the service he had
done him, in any way he might desire.&nbsp; And when they went to
meat, Peredur was placed beside the King, and the maiden on the 
other side of Peredur, &ldquo;I will give thee,&rdquo; said the 
King, &ldquo;my daughter in marriage, and half my kingdom with 
her, and the two Earldoms as a gift.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven 
reward thee, lord,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;but I came not 
here to woo.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What seekest thou, then, 
chieftain?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am seeking tidings of the Castle
of Wonders.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy enterprise is greater, 
chieftain, than thou wilt wish to pursue,&rdquo; said the maiden,
&ldquo;nevertheless, tidings shalt thou have of the Castle, and 
thou shalt have a guide through my father&rsquo;s dominions, and 
a sufficiency of provisions for thy journey, for thou art, O 
chieftain, the man whom best I love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she said 
to him, &ldquo;Go over yonder mountain, and thou wilt find a 
Lake, and in the middle of the Lake there is a Castle, and that 
is the Castle that is called the Castle of Wonders; and we <!-- 
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
102</span>know not what wonders are therein, but thus is it 
called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Peredur proceeded towards the Castle, and the gate of the 
Castle was open.&nbsp; And when he came to the hall, the door was
open, and he entered.&nbsp; And he beheld a chessboard in the 
hall, and the chessmen were playing against each other, by 
themselves.&nbsp; And the side that he favoured lost the game, <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102" 
class="citation">[102]</a> and thereupon the others set up a 
shout, as though they had been living men.&nbsp; And Peredur was 
wroth, and took the chessmen in his lap, and cast the chessboard 
into the lake.&nbsp; And when he had done thus, behold the black 
maiden came in, and she said to him, &ldquo;The welcome of Heaven
be not unto thee.&nbsp; Thou hadst rather do evil than 
good.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What complaint hast thou against me, 
maiden?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;That thou hast 
occasioned unto the Empress the loss of her chessboard, which she
would not have lost for all her empire.&nbsp; And the way in 
which thou mayest recover the chessboard is, to repair to the 
Castle of Ysbidinongyl, where is a black man, who lays waste the 
dominions of the Empress; and if thou canst slay him, thou wilt 
recover the chessboard.&nbsp; But if thou goest there, thou wilt 
not return alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou direct me 
thither?&rdquo; said Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will show thee the 
way,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; So he went to the Castle of 
Ysbidinongyl, and he fought with the black man.&nbsp; And the 
black man besought mercy of Peredur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy will I 
grant thee,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;on condition that thou cause 
the chessboard to be restored to the place where it was when I 
entered the hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the maiden came to him and 
said, &ldquo;The malediction of Heaven attend thee for thy work, 
since thou hast left that monster alive, who lays waste all the 
possessions <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>of the Empress.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I granted him his life,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;that 
he might cause the chessboard to be restored.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The chessboard is not in the place where thou didst find 
it; go back, therefore, and slay him,&rdquo; answered she.&nbsp; 
So Peredur went back, and slew the black man.&nbsp; And when he 
returned to the palace, he found the black maiden there.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ah! maiden,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;where is the 
Empress?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare to Heaven that thou wilt 
not see her now, unless thou dost slay the monster that is in 
yonder forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What monster is 
there?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a stag that is as swift as the 
swiftest bird; and he has one horn in his forehead, as long as 
the shaft of a spear and as sharp as whatever is sharpest.&nbsp; 
And he destroys the branches of the best trees in the forest and 
he kills every animal that he meets with therein; and those that 
he does not slay perish of hunger.&nbsp; And what is worse than 
that, he comes every night, and drinks up the fish pond, and 
leaves the fishes exposed, so that for the most part they die 
before the water returns again.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Maiden,&rdquo; said Peredur, &ldquo;wilt thou come and 
show me this animal?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said the 
maiden, &ldquo;for he has not permitted any mortal to enter the 
forest for above a twelvemonth.&nbsp; Behold, here is a little 
dog belonging to the Empress, which will rouse the stag, and will
chase him towards thee, and the stag will attack 
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the little dog went as a guide to 
Peredur, and roused the stag, and brought him towards the place 
where Peredur was.&nbsp; And the stag attacked Peredur, and he 
let him pass by him, and as he did so, he smote off his head with
his sword.&nbsp; And while he was looking at the head of the 
stag, he saw a lady on horseback coming towards him.&nbsp; And 
she took the little dog in the lappet of her cap, and the head 
and the body of the <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>stag lay before her.&nbsp; And 
around the stag&rsquo;s neck was a golden collar.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ha! chieftain,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;uncourteously hast 
thou acted in slaying the fairest jewel that was in my 
dominions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was intreated so to do; and is 
there any way by which I can obtain thy friendship?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go thou forward
unto yonder mountain, and there thou wilt find a grove; and in 
the grove there is a cromlech, do thou there challenge a man 
three times to fight, and thou shalt have my 
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Peredur proceeded onward, and came to the side of the 
grove, and challenged any man to fight.&nbsp; And a black man 
arose from beneath the cromlech, mounted upon a bony horse, and 
both he and his horse were clad in huge rusty armour.&nbsp; And 
they fought.&nbsp; And as often as Peredur cast the black man to 
the earth, he would jump again into his saddle.&nbsp; And Peredur
dismounted, and drew his sword; and thereupon the black man 
disappeared with Peredur&rsquo;s horse and his own, so that he 
could not gain sight of him a second time.&nbsp; And Peredur went
along the mountain, and on the other side of the mountain he 
beheld a castle in the valley, wherein was a river.&nbsp; And he 
went to the castle; and as he entered it, he saw a hall, and the 
door of the hall was open, and he went in.&nbsp; And there he saw
a lame grey-headed man, sitting on one side of the hall, with 
Gwalchmai beside him.&nbsp; And Peredur beheld his horse, which 
the black man had taken, in the same stall with that of 
Gwalchmai.&nbsp; And they were glad concerning Peredur.&nbsp; And
he went and seated himself on the other side of the hoary-headed 
man.&nbsp; Then, behold a yellow-haired youth came, and bent upon
the knee before Peredur, and besought his friendship.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;it was I that came in 
the form of the black maiden <!-- page 105--><a 
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>to 
Arthur&rsquo;s Court, and when thou didst throw down the 
chessboard, and when thou didst slay the black man of 
Ysbidinongyl, and when thou didst slay the stag, and when thou 
didst go to fight the black man of the cromlech.&nbsp; And I came
with the bloody head in the salver, and with the lance that 
streamed with blood from the point to the hand, all along the 
shaft; and the head was thy cousin&rsquo;s, and he was killed by 
the sorceresses of Gloucester, who also lamed thine uncle; and I 
am thy cousin.&nbsp; And there is a prediction that thou art to 
avenge these things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Peredur and Gwalchmai took
counsel, and sent to Arthur and his household, to beseech them to
come against the sorceresses.&nbsp; And they began to fight with 
them, and one of the sorceresses slew one of Arthur&rsquo;s men 
before Peredur&rsquo;s face, and Peredur bade her forbear.&nbsp; 
And the sorceress slew a man before Peredur&rsquo;s face a second
time, and a second time he forbade her.&nbsp; And the third time 
the sorceress slew a man before <!-- page 106--><a 
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the face of
Peredur, and then Peredur drew his sword, and smote the sorceress
on the helmet, and all her head armour was split in two 
parts.&nbsp; And she set up a cry, and desired the other 
sorceresses to flee, and told them that this was Peredur, the man
who had learnt Chivalry with them, and by whom they were destined
to be slain.&nbsp; Then Arthur and his household fell upon the 
sorceresses, and slew the sorceresses of Gloucester every one And
thus is it related concerning the Castle of Wonders.</p>

<p>Madawc the son of Maredudd possessed Powys within its 
boundaries, from Porfoed to Gwauan in the uplands of 
Arwystli.&nbsp; And at that time he had a brother, Iorwerth the 
son of Maredudd, in rank not equal to himself.&nbsp; And Iorwerth
had great sorrow and heaviness because of the honour and power 
that his brother enjoyed, which he shared <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>not.&nbsp; 
And he sought his fellows and his foster-brothers, and took 
counsel with them what he should do in this matter.&nbsp; And 
they resolved to despatch some of their number to go and seek a 
maintenance for him.&nbsp; Then Madawc offered him to become 
Master of the Household and to have horses, and arms, and honour,
and to fare like as himself.&nbsp; But Iorwerth refused this.</p>
<p>And Iorwerth made an inroad into England, slaying the 
inhabitants, and burning houses, and carrying away 
prisoners.&nbsp; And Madawc took counsel with the men of Powys, 
and they determined to place an hundred men in each of the three 
Commots of Powys to seek for him.&nbsp; And thus did they in the 
plains of Powys from Aber Ceirawc, and in Allictwn Ver, and in 
Rhyd Wilure, on the Vyrnwy, the three best Commots of 
Powys.&nbsp; So he was none the better, he nor his household, in 
Powys, nor in the plains thereof. <a name="citation108"></a><a 
href="#footnote108" class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; And they 
spread these men over the plains as far as Nillystwn Trevan.</p>
<p>Now one of the men who was upon this quest was called 
Rhonabwy.&nbsp; And Rhonabwy and Kynwrig Vrychgoch, a man of 
Mawddwy, and Cadwgan Vras, a man of Moelvre in Kynlleith, came 
together to the house of Heilyn Goch the son of Cadwgan the son 
of Iddon.&nbsp; And when they near to the house, they saw an old 
hall, very black and having an upright gable, whence issued a 
great smoke; and on entering, they found the floor full of 
puddles and mounds; and it was difficult to stand thereon, so 
slippery was it <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>with the mire of cattle.&nbsp; And 
where the puddles were a man might go up to his ankles in water 
and dirt.&nbsp; And there were boughs of holly spread over the 
floor whereof the cattle had browsed the sprigs.&nbsp; When they 
came to the hall of the house, they beheld cells full of dust, 
and very gloomy, <a name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a> and on one side an old hag making a 
fire.&nbsp; And whenever she felt cold, she cast a lapful of 
chaff upon the fire, and raised such a smoke, that it was 
scarcely to be borne, as it rose up the nostrils.&nbsp; And on 
the other side was a yellow calf skin on the floor, a main 
privilege was it to any one who should get upon that hide.</p>
<p>And when they had sat down, they asked the hag where were the 
people of the house.&nbsp; And the hag spoke not but 
muttered.&nbsp; Thereupon behold the people of the house entered;
a ruddy, clownish curly-headed man, with a burthen of fagots on 
his back, and a pale slender woman, also carrying a bundle under 
her arm.&nbsp; And they barely welcomed the men, and kindled a 
fire with the boughs.&nbsp; And the woman cooked something and 
gave them to eat, barley bread, and cheese, and milk and 
water.</p>
<p>And there arose a storm of wind and rain, so that it was 
hardly possible to go forth with safety.&nbsp; And being weary 
with their journey, they laid themselves down and sought to 
sleep.&nbsp; And when they looked at the couch, it seemed to be 
made but of a little coarse straw full of dust and vermin, with 
the stems of boughs sticking up therethrough, for the cattle had 
eaten all the straw that was placed at the head and the 
foot.&nbsp; And upon it was stretched an old russet-coloured rug,
threadbare and ragged; and a coarse sheet, full of slits was upon
the rug, and an ill-stuffed pillow, and a worn-out cover upon the
sheet.&nbsp; And <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>after much suffering from the 
vermin, and from the discomfort of their couch, a heavy sleep 
fell on Rhonabwy&rsquo;s companions.&nbsp; But Rhonabwy, not 
being able either to sleep or to rest, thought he should suffer 
less if he went to lie upon the yellow calfskin that was 
stretched out on the floor.&nbsp; And there he slept.</p>
<p>As soon as sleep had come upon his eyes, it seemed to him that
he was journeying with his companions across the plain of 
Argyngroeg, and he thought that he went towards Rhyd y Groes on 
the Severn.&nbsp; As he journeyed, he heard a mighty noise, the 
like whereof heard he never before; and looking behind him, he 
beheld a youth with yellow curling hair, and with his beard newly
trimmed, mounted on a chesnut horse, whereof the legs were grey 
from the top of the forelegs, and from the bend of the hindlegs 
downwards.&nbsp; And the rider wore a coat of yellow satin sewn 
with green silk, and on his thigh was a gold-hilted sword, with a
scabbard of new leather of Cordova, belted with the skin of the 
deer, and clasped with gold.&nbsp; And over this was a scarf of 
yellow satin wrought with green silk, the borders whereof were 
likewise green.&nbsp; And the green of the caparison of the 
horse, and of his rider, was as green as the leaves of the fir 
tree, and the yellow was as yellow as the blossom of the 
broom.&nbsp; So fierce was the aspect of the knight, that fear 
seized upon them, and they began to flee.&nbsp; And the knight 
pursued them.&nbsp; And when the horse breathed forth, the men 
became distant from him, and when he drew in his breath, they 
were drawn near to him, even to the horse&rsquo;s chest.&nbsp; 
And when he had overtaken them, they besought his mercy.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You have it gladly!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;fear 
nought.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, chieftain, since thou hast <!-- 
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>mercy upon me, tell me also who thou art,&rdquo; said 
Rhonabwy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not conceal my lineage from 
thee.&nbsp; I am Iddawc the son of Mynyo, yet not by my name, but
by my nickname am I best known.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And wilt thou
tell us what thy nickname is?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell 
you; it is Iddawc Cordd Prydain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, 
chieftain,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;why art thou called 
thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell thee.&nbsp; I was one of 
the messengers between Arthur and Medrawd his nephew, at the 
battle of Camlan; and I was then a reckless youth, and through my
desire for battle, I kindled strife between them, and stirred up 
wrath, when I was sent by Arthur the Emperor to reason with 
Medrawd, and to shew him, that he was his foster-father and his 
uncle, and to seek for peace, lest the sons of the Kings of the 
Island of Britain, and of the nobles, should be slain.&nbsp; And 
whereas Arthur charged me with the fairest sayings he could think
of, I uttered unto Medrawd the harshest I could devise.&nbsp; And
therefore am I called Iddawc Cordd Prydain, for from this did the
battle of Camlan ensue.&nbsp; And three nights before the end of 
the battle of Camlan I left them, and went to the Llech Las in 
North Britain to do penance.&nbsp; And there I remained doing 
penance seven years, and after that I gained pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then lo! they heard a mighty sound which was much louder than 
that which they had heard before, and when they looked round 
towards the sound; behold a ruddy youth, without beard or 
whiskers, <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111" 
class="citation">[111]</a> noble of mien, and mounted on a 
stately courser.&nbsp; And from the shoulders and the front of 
the knees downwards the horse was bay.&nbsp; And upon the man was
a dress of red satin wrought with yellow silk, and yellow were 
the borders of his scarf.&nbsp; And such parts <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>of his 
apparel and of the trappings of his horse as were yellow, as 
yellow were they as the blossom of the broom, and such as were 
red, were as ruddy as the ruddiest blood in the world.</p>
<p>Then behold the horseman overtook them, and he asked of Iddawc
a share of the little men that were with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;That 
which is fitting for me to grant I will grant, and thou shalt be 
a companion to them as I have been.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the horseman
went away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; enquired Rhonabwy, 
&ldquo;who was that horseman?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rhuvawn Pebyr, 
the son of Prince Deorthach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they journeyed over the plain of Argyngroeg as far as the 
ford of Rhyd y Groes on the Severn.&nbsp; And for a mile around 
the ford on both sides of the road, they saw tents and 
encampments, and there was the clamour of a mighty host.&nbsp; 
And they came to the edge of the ford, and there they beheld 
Arthur sitting on a flat island below the ford, having Bedwini <a
name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112" 
class="citation">[112]</a> the Bishop on one side of him, and 
Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw on the other.&nbsp; And a tall 
auburn-haired youth stood before him, with his sheathed sword in 
his hand, and clad in a coat and a cap of jet black satin.&nbsp; 
And his face was white as ivory, and his eyebrows black as jet, 
and such part of his wrist as could be seen between his glove and
his sleeve was whiter than the lily, and thicker than a 
warrior&rsquo;s ankle.</p>
<p>Then came Iddawc and they that were with him, and stood before
Arthur, and saluted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven grant thee 
good,&rdquo; said Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;And where, Iddawc, didst 
thou find these little men?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I found them, 
lord, up yonder on the road.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the Emperor 
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Iddawc, &ldquo;wherefore 
dost thou laugh?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; replied 
Arthur, &ldquo;I laugh nor; <!-- page 113--><a 
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>but it 
pitieth me that men of such stature as these should have this 
Island in their keeping, after the men that guarded it of 
yore.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Iddawc, &ldquo;Rhonabwy, dost thou 
see the ring with a stone set in it, that is upon the 
Emperor&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is one of the properties of that stone,
to enable thee to remember that thou seest here to-night, and 
hadst thou not seen the stone, thou wouldest never have been able
to remember aught thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this they saw a troop coming towards the ford.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; enquired Rhonabwy, &ldquo;to whom does 
yonder troop belong?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are the fellows of 
Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach.&nbsp; And these men 
are honourably served with mead and bragget, and are freely 
beloved by the daughters of the kings of the Island of 
Britain.&nbsp; And this they merit, for they were ever in the 
front and the rear in every peril.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he saw but 
one hue upon the men and the horses of this troop, for they were 
all as red as blood.&nbsp; And when one of the knights rode forth
from the troop, he looked like a pillar of fire glancing athwart 
the sky.&nbsp; And this troop encamped above the ford.</p>
<p>Then they beheld another troop coming towards the ford, and 
these from their horses&rsquo; chests upwards were whiter than 
the lily, and below blacker than jet.&nbsp; And they saw one of 
these knights go before the rest, and spur his horse into the 
ford in such a manner that the water dashed over Arthur and the 
Bishop, and those holding counsel with them, so that they were as
wet as if they had been drenched in the river.&nbsp; And as he 
turned the head of his horse, the youth who stood before Arthur 
struck the horse over the nostrils with his sheathed sword, so 
that had it been <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>with the bare blade it would have 
been a marvel if the bone had not been wounded as well as the 
flesh.&nbsp; And the knight drew his sword half out of the 
scabbard, and asked of him, &ldquo;Wherefore didst thou strike my
horse?&nbsp; Whether was it in insult or in counsel unto 
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou dost indeed lack counsel.&nbsp; What
madness caused thee to ride so furiously as to dash the water of 
the ford over Arthur, and the consecrated Bishop, and their 
counsellors, so that they were as wet as if they had been dragged
out of the river?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As counsel then will I take
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he turned his horse&rsquo;s head round 
towards his army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;who was yonder 
knight?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The most eloquent and the wisest 
youth that is in this Island; Adaon the son of 
Taliesin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was the man that struck his 
horse?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A youth of froward nature; Elphin the 
son of Gwyddno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then spake a tall and stately man, of noble and flowing 
speech, saying that it was a marvel that so vast a host should be
assembled in so narrow a space, and that it was a still greater 
marvel that those should be there at that time who had promised 
to be by mid-day in the battle of Badon, fighting with Osla 
Gyllellvawr.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whether thou mayest choose to proceed 
or not, I will proceed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou sayest 
well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and we will go all 
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, 
&ldquo;who was the man who spoke so marvellously unto Arthur 
erewhile?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A man who may speak as boldly as he
listeth, Caradawc Vreichvras, the son of Llyr Marini, his chief 
counsellor and his cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Iddawc took Rhonabwy behind him on his horse, and that 
mighty host moved forward, each troop in its order, towards 
Cevndigoll.&nbsp; And when <!-- page 115--><a 
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>they came 
to the middle of the ford of the Severn, Iddawc turned his 
horse&rsquo;s head, and Rhonabwy looked along the valley of the 
Severn.&nbsp; And he beheld two fair troops coming towards the 
ford.&nbsp; One troop there came of brilliant white, whereof 
every one of the men had a scarf of white satin with jet black 
borders.&nbsp; And the knees and the tops of the shoulders of 
their horses were jet black, though they were of a pure white in 
every other part.&nbsp; And their banners were pure white, with 
black points to them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;who are yonder 
pure white troop?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are the men of Norway,
and March the son of Meirchion is their prince.&nbsp; And he is 
cousin unto Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; And further on he saw a troop, 
whereof each man wore garments of jet black, with borders of pure
white to every scarf; and the tops of the shoulders and the knees
of their horses were pure white.&nbsp; And their banners were jet
black with pure white at the point of each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;who are the jet 
black troop yonder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are the men of 
Denmark, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd is their prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they had overtaken the host, Arthur and his army of 
mighty ones dismounted below Caer Badon, and he perceived that he
and Iddawc journeyed the same road as Arthur.&nbsp; And after 
they had dismounted he heard a great tumult and confusion amongst
the host, and such as were then at the flanks, turned to the 
centre, and such as had been in the centre moved to the 
flanks.&nbsp; And then, behold, he saw a knight coming, clad, 
both he and his horse, in mail, of which the rings were whiter 
than the whitest lily, and the rivets redder than the ruddies 
blood.&nbsp; And he rode amongst the host.</p>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;will yonder
host flee?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;King Arthur never fled, and if 
this discourse of thine were heard, thou wert a lost man.&nbsp; 
But as to the knight whom thou seest yonder, it is Kai.&nbsp; The
fairest horseman is Kai in all Arthur&rsquo;s Court; and the men 
who are at the front of the army hasten to the rear to see Kai 
ride, and the men who are in the centre, flee to the side from 
the shock of his horse. <a name="citation116a"></a><a 
href="#footnote116a" class="citation">[116a]</a>&nbsp; And this 
is the cause of the confusion of the host.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon they heard a call made for Kadwr, Earl of Cornwall, 
and behold he arose with the sword of Arthur in his hand.&nbsp; 
And the similitude of two serpents was upon the sword in 
gold.&nbsp; And when the sword was drawn from its scabbard, it 
seemed as if two flames of fire burst forth from the jaws of the 
serpents, and then, so wonderful was the sword, that it was hard 
for any one to look upon it.&nbsp; And the host became still, and
the tumult ceased, and the Earl returned to the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;who is the man who
bore the sword of Arthur?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Kadwr, the Earl of 
Cornwall, whose duty is to arm the King on the days of battle and
warfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they heard a call made for Eirynwych Amheibyn, 
Arthur&rsquo;s servant, a red, rough, ill-favoured man, having 
red whiskers <a name="citation116b"></a><a href="#footnote116b" 
class="citation">[116b]</a> with bristly hairs.&nbsp; And behold 
he came upon a tall red horse, with the mane parted on each side,
and he brought with him a large and beautiful sumpter pack.&nbsp;
And the huge red youth dismounted before Arthur, and he drew a 
golden chair out of the pack, and a carpet of diapered 
satin.&nbsp; And he spread the carpet before Arthur, and there 
was an apple of ruddy gold at each corner thereof, <!-- page 
117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
117</span>and he placed the chair upon the carpet.&nbsp; And so 
large was the chair that three armed warriors might have sat 
therein.&nbsp; Gwenn was the name of the carpet, and it was one 
of its properties, that whoever was upon it no one could see him,
and he could see every one.&nbsp; And it would retain no colour 
but its own.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p117.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p117.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And Arthur sat within the carpet, and Owain the son of Urien 
was standing before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Owain,&rdquo; said Arthur, 
&ldquo;wilt thou play chess?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, 
Lord,&rdquo; said Owain.&nbsp; And the red youth brought the 
chess for Arthur and Owain; golden pieces and a board of 
silver.&nbsp; And they began to play.</p>
<p>And while they were thus, and when they were best amused with 
their game, behold they saw a white tent with a red canopy, and 
the figure of a jet black <!-- page 118--><a 
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>serpent on 
the top of the tent, and red glaring venomous eyes in the head of
the serpent, and a red flaming tongue.&nbsp; And there came a 
young page with yellow curling hair, and blue eyes, and a newly 
springing beard, wearing a coat and a surcoat of yellow satin, 
and hose of thin greenish yellow cloth upon his feet, and over 
his hose shoes of parti-coloured leather, fastened at the insteps
with golden clasps.&nbsp; And he bore a heavy three-edged sword 
with a golden hilt, in a scabbard of black leather tipped with 
fine gold.&nbsp; And he came to the place where the Emperor and 
Owain were playing at chess.</p>
<p>And the youth saluted Owain.&nbsp; And Owain marvelled that 
the youth should salute him and should not have saluted the 
Emperor Arthur.&nbsp; And Arthur knew what was in Owain&rsquo;s 
thought.&nbsp; And he said to Owain, &ldquo;Marvel not that the 
youth salutes thee now, for he saluted me erewhile; and it is 
unto thee that his errand is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said the youth 
unto Owain, &ldquo;Lord, is it with thy leave that the young 
pages and attendants of the Emperor harass and torment and worry 
the Ravens?&nbsp; And if it be not with thy leave, cause the 
Emperor to forbid them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said 
Owain, &ldquo;thou hearest what the youth says; if it seem good 
to thee, forbid them from my Ravens.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Play thy
game,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; Then the youth returned to the 
tent.</p>
<p>That game did they finish, and another they began, and when 
they were in the midst of the game, behold, a ruddy young man 
with auburn curling hair, and large eyes, well grown, and having 
his beard new shorn, came forth from a bright yellow tent, upon 
the summit of which was the figure of a bright red lion.&nbsp; 
And he was clad in a coat of yellow satin, falling as low as the 
small of his leg, and embroidered with threads of red <!-- page 
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
119</span>silk.&nbsp; And on his feet were hose of fine white 
buckram, and buskins of black leather were over his hose, whereon
were golden clasps.&nbsp; And in his hand a huge, heavy, 
three-edged sword, with a scabbard of red-deer hide, tipped with 
gold.&nbsp; And he came to the place where Arthur and Owain were 
playing at chess.&nbsp; And he saluted him.&nbsp; And Owain was 
troubled at his salutation, but Arthur minded it no more than 
before.&nbsp; And the youth said unto Owain, &ldquo;Is it not 
against thy will that the attendants of the Emperor harass thy 
Ravens, killing some and worrying others?&nbsp; If against thy 
will it be, beseech him to forbid them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;forbid thy men if it seem 
good to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Play thy game,&rdquo; said the 
Emperor.&nbsp; And the youth returned to the tent.</p>
<p>And that game was ended, and another begun.&nbsp; And as they 
were beginning the first move of the game, they beheld at a small
distance from them a tent speckled yellow, the largest ever seen,
and the figure of an eagle of gold upon it, and a precious stone 
on the eagle&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; And coming out of the tent, they
saw a youth with thick yellow hair upon his head, fair and 
comely, and a scarf of blue satin upon him, and a brooch of gold 
in the scarf upon his right shoulder as large as a 
warrior&rsquo;s middle finger.&nbsp; And upon his feet were hose 
of fine Totness, and shoes of parti-coloured leather, clasped 
with gold, and the youth was of noble bearing, fair of face, with
ruddy cheeks and large hawk&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; In the hand of 
the youth was a mighty lance, speckled yellow, with a newly 
sharpened head; and upon the lance a banner displayed.</p>
<p>Fiercely angry, and with rapid pace, came the youth to the 
place where Arthur was playing at chess with Owain.&nbsp; And 
they perceived that he was wroth.&nbsp; <!-- page 120--><a 
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>And 
thereupon he saluted Owain, and told him that his Ravens had been
killed, the chief part of them, and that such of them as were not
slain were so wounded and bruised that not one of them could 
raise its wings a single fathom above the earth.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said Owain, &ldquo;forbid thy 
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Play,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;if it please
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said Owain to the youth, &ldquo;Go back, 
and wherever thou findest the strife at the thickest, there lift 
up the banner, and let come what pleases Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; So 
the youth returned back to the place where the strife bore 
hardest upon the Ravens, and he lifted up the banner; and as he 
did so they all rose up in the air, wrathful and fierce and high 
of spirit, clapping their wings in the wind, and shaking off the 
weariness that was upon them.&nbsp; And recovering their energy 
and courage, furiously and with exultation did they, with one 
sweep, descend upon the heads of the men, who had erewhile caused
them anger and pain and damage, and they seized some by the heads
and others by the eyes, and some by the ears, and others by the 
arms, and carried them up into the air; and in the air there was 
a mighty tumult with the flapping of the wings of the triumphant 
Ravens, and with their croaking; and there was another mighty 
tumult with the groaning of the men, that were being torn and 
wounded, and some of whom were slain.</p>
<p>And Arthur and Owain marvelled at the tumult as they played at
chess; and, looking, they perceived a knight upon a dun-coloured 
horse coming towards them.&nbsp; And marvellous was the hue of 
the dun horse.&nbsp; Bright red was his right shoulder, and from 
the top of his legs to the centre of his hoof was bright 
yellow.&nbsp; Both the knight and his horse were fully equipped 
with heavy foreign armour.&nbsp; The clothing of the horse <!-- 
page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
121</span>from the front opening upwards was of bright red 
sendal, and from thence opening downwards was of bright yellow 
sendal.&nbsp; A large gold-hilted one-edged sword had the youth 
upon his thigh, in a scabbard of light blue, and tipped with 
Spanish laton.&nbsp; The belt of the sword was of dark green 
leather with golden slides and a clasp of ivory upon it, and a 
buckle of jet black upon the clasp.&nbsp; A helmet of gold was on
the head of the knight, set with precious stones of great virtue,
and at the top of the helmet was the image of a flame-coloured 
leopard with two ruby-red stones in its head, so that it was 
astounding for a warrior, however stout his heart, to look at the
face of the leopard, much more at the face of the knight.&nbsp; 
He had in his hand a blue-shafted lance, but from the haft to the
point it was stained crimson-red, with the blood of the Ravens 
and their plumage.</p>
<p>The knight came to the place where Arthur and Owain were 
seated at chess.&nbsp; And they perceived that he was harassed 
and vexed and weary as he came towards them.&nbsp; And the youth 
saluted Arthur, and told him, that the Ravens of Owain were 
slaying his young men and attendants.&nbsp; And Arthur looked at 
Owain and said, &ldquo;Forbid thy Ravens.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; answered Owain, &ldquo;play thy 
game.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they played.&nbsp; And the knight returned
back towards the strife, and the Ravens were not forbade any more
than before.</p>
<p>And when they had played awhile, they heard a mighty tumult, 
and a wailing of men, and a croaking of Ravens, as they carried 
the men in their strength into the air, and, tearing them betwixt
them, let them fall piecemeal to the earth.&nbsp; And during the 
tumult they saw a knight coming towards them on a light grey 
horse, and the left foreleg of the horse was jet black to the 
centre of his hoof.&nbsp; And the knight and <!-- page 122--><a 
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>the horse 
were fully accoutred with huge heavy blue armour.&nbsp; And a 
robe of honour of yellow diapered satin was upon the knight, and 
the borders of the robe were blue.&nbsp; And the housings of the 
horse were jet black, with borders of bright yellow.&nbsp; And on
the thigh of the youth was a sword, long, and three-edged, and 
heavy.&nbsp; And the scabbard was of red cut leather, and the 
belt of new red deerskin, having upon it many golden slides and a
buckle of the bone of the sea horse, the tongue of which was jet 
black.&nbsp; A golden helmet was upon the head of the knight, 
wherein were set sapphire stones of great virtue.&nbsp; And at 
the top of the helmet was the figure of a flame-coloured lion, 
with a fiery-red tongue, issuing above a foot from his mouth, and
with venomous eyes, crimson-red, in his head.&nbsp; And the 
knight came, bearing in his hand a thick ashen lance, the head 
whereof, which had been newly steeped in blood, was overlaid with
silver.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p122.jpg">
<img alt="Picture" src="images/p122.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>And the youth saluted the Emperor: &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;carest thou not for the slaying of thy pages, and thy 
young men, and the sons of the nobles of the Island of Britain, 
whereby it will be difficult to <!-- page 123--><a 
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>defend this
Island from henceforward for ever?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Owain,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;forbid thy 
Ravens.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Play this game, Lord,&rdquo; said 
Owain.</p>
<p>So they finished the game, and began another; and as they were
finishing that game, lo, they heard a great tumult and a clamour 
of armed men, and a croaking of Ravens, and a flapping of wings 
in the air, as they flung down the armour entire to the ground, 
and the men and the horses piecemeal.&nbsp; Then they saw coming 
a knight on a lofty-headed piebald horse.&nbsp; And the left 
shoulder of the horse was of bright red, and its right leg from 
the chest to the hollow of the hoof was pure white.&nbsp; And the
knight and horse were equipped with arms of speckled yellow, 
variegated with Spanish laton.&nbsp; And there was a robe of 
honour upon him, and upon his horse, divided in two parts, white 
and black, and the borders of the robe of honour were of golden 
purple.&nbsp; And above the robe he wore a sword three-edged and 
bright, with a golden hilt.&nbsp; And the belt of the sword was 
of yellow goldwork, having a clasp upon it of the eyelid of a 
black sea horse, and a tongue of yellow gold to the clasp.&nbsp; 
Upon the head of the knight was a bright helmet of yellow laton, 
with sparkling stones of crystal in it, and at the crest of the 
helmet was the figure of a griffin, with a stone of many virtues 
in its head.&nbsp; And he had an ashen spear in his hand, with a 
round shaft, coloured with azure blue.&nbsp; And the head of the 
spear was newly stained with blood, and was overlaid with fine 
silver.</p>
<p>Wrathfully came the knight to the place where Arthur was, and 
he told him that the Ravens had slain his household and the sons 
of the chief men of this Island, and he besought him to cause 
Owain to forbid his Ravens.&nbsp; And Arthur besought Owain <!-- 
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
124</span>to forbid them.&nbsp; Then Arthur took the golden 
chessmen that were upon the board, and crushed them until they 
became as dust.&nbsp; Then Owain ordered Gwres the son of Rheged 
to lower his banner.&nbsp; So it was lowered, and all was 
peace.</p>
<p>Then Rhonabwy enquired of Iddawc, who were the first three men
that came to Owain, to tell him his Ravens were being 
slain.&nbsp; Said Iddawc, &ldquo;They were men who grieved that 
Owain should suffer loss, his fellow-chieftains and companions, 
Selyv the son of Kynan Garwyn of Powys, and Gwgawn Gleddyvrudd, 
and Gwres the son of Rheged, he who bears the banner in the day 
of battle and strife.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; said 
Rhonabwy, &ldquo;were the last three men who came to Arthur, and 
told him that the Ravens were slaughtering his men?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The best of men,&rdquo; said Iddawc, &ldquo;and the 
bravest, and who would grieve exceedingly that Arthur should have
damage in aught; Blathaon, the son of Mawrheth, <a 
name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a" 
class="citation">[124a]</a> and Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince 
Deorthach, and Hyveidd Unllenn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that behold four and twenty knights came from Osla 
Gyllellvawr, to crave a truce of Arthur for a fortnight and a 
month.&nbsp; And Arthur arose and went to take counsel.&nbsp; And
he came to where a tall auburn curly-headed man was a little way 
off, and there he assembled his counsellors.&nbsp; Bedwini, <a

of Tegid, and Rhyawd the son of Morgant, and Dyvyr the son of 
Alun Dyved, Gwrhyr Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Adaon the son of

Vreichvras, Gildas the son of Kaw, Kadyriaith the son of Saidi, 
and many of the men of Norway, and Denmark, and many of the men 
of Greece, and a crowd of the men of the host came to that 
counsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iddawc,&rdquo; said Rhonabwy, &ldquo;who was the auburn
haired man to whom they came just now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rhun 
the son of Maelgwn Gwynedd, a man of whose prerogative it is, 
that he may join in counsel with all.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation125f"></a><a href="#footnote125f" 
class="citation">[125f]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;And wherefore did they 
admit into counsel with men of such dignity as are yonder a 
stripling so young as Kadyriaith the son of Saidi?&rdquo;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Because there is not throughout Britain a man better 
skilled in counsel than he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, behold, bards came and recited verses before 
Arthur, and no man understood those verses, <!-- page 126--><a 
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>but 
Kadyriaith only, save that they were in Arthur&rsquo;s 
praise.</p>
<p>And, lo, there came four and twenty asses with their burdens 
of gold and of silver, and a tired wayworn man with each of them,
bringing tribute to Arthur from the Islands of Greece.&nbsp; Then
Kadyriaith the son of Saidi besought that a truce might be 
granted to Osla Gyllellvawr for the space of a fortnight and a 
month, and that the asses and the burdens they carried might be 
given to the bards, to be to them as the reward for their stay 
and that their verse might be recompensed, during the time of the
truce.&nbsp; And thus it was settled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhonabwy,&rdquo; said Iddawc, &ldquo;would it not be 
wrong to forbid a youth who can give counsel so liberal as this 
from coming to the councils of his Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Kai arose, and he said, &ldquo;Whosoever will follow 
Arthur, let him be with him to-night in Cornwall, and whosoever 
will not, let him be opposed to Arthur even during the 
truce.&rdquo;&nbsp; And through the <!-- page 127--><a 
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>greatness 
of the tumult that ensued, Rhonabwy awoke.&nbsp; And when he 
awoke he was upon the yellow calfskin, having slept three nights 
and three days.</p>
<p>And this tale is called The Dream of Rhonabwy.&nbsp; And this 
is the reason that no one knows the dream without a book, neither
bard nor gifted seer; because of the various colours that were 
upon the horses, and the many wondrous colours of the arms and of
the panoply, and of the precious scarfs, and of the 
virtue-bearing stones.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
